1,"00:04:03,748","00:04:05,875",Derek.
2,"00:04:11,464","00:04:13,425",What the fuck are you thinking?
3,"00:04:13,466","00:04:16,428",There's a black guy outside breaking into your car.
4,"00:04:16,469","00:04:18,805",How long has he been there?
5,"00:04:18,840","00:04:20,223",I don't know.
6,"00:04:20,265","00:04:21,558",What's going on?
7,"00:04:21,599","00:04:23,977","Not right now, honey. How many?"
8,"00:04:24,019","00:04:25,312","Danny, how many?"
9,"00:04:25,353","00:04:26,604","One, I think."
10,"00:04:26,646","00:04:28,648",Is he strapped?
11,"00:04:28,690","00:04:30,066",Does he have a gun?
12,"00:04:30,108","00:04:31,776",I don't fucking know.
13,"00:04:33,528","00:04:35,947",Wait a second. What the fuck is going on?
14,"00:04:35,989","00:04:38,325",Stay right here and be quiet.
15,"00:04:38,366","00:04:40,869","Wait a second, Derek. Wait."
16,"00:04:46,082","00:04:47,375",Stay right here.
17,"00:06:29,102","00:06:31,062",I don't have a personal problem with him.
18,"00:06:31,104","00:06:33,231","Don't insult my intelligence, Murray."
19,"00:06:33,273","00:06:36,318","You hate this child, and I think I know why."
20,"00:06:42,198","00:06:44,242",Dr. Sweeney's office.
21,"00:06:44,284","00:06:46,536",I went out with his mother a few times.
22,"00:06:46,578","00:06:48,747",That was three years ago. It was nothing.
23,"00:06:48,788","00:06:50,290",Nothing. Really?
24,"00:06:50,332","00:06:53,543","That paper- Bob, it's a travesty."
25,"00:06:53,585","00:06:56,671",Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights hero.
26,"00:06:56,713","00:06:58,131",You've got to draw the line.
27,"00:07:02,052","00:07:04,971",on any book that related to the struggle for civil rights...
28,"00:07:05,006","00:07:06,438",in plain English.
29,"00:07:06,473","00:07:10,310",I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused...
30,"00:07:10,345","00:07:12,277",and harbors some sick ideas...
31,"00:07:12,312","00:07:15,065",but I am not ready to give up on him yet.
32,"00:07:15,106","00:07:17,817",His brother probably put him up to it.
33,"00:07:17,859","00:07:20,195",I guarantee you 100%%...
34,"00:07:20,236","00:07:22,405",his brother did not put him up to this.
35,"00:07:22,447","00:07:24,491",I find that hard to believe.
36,"00:07:24,532","00:07:26,242",I know he was a good kid...
37,"00:07:26,284","00:07:28,995","and it's a shame what he's been through, but that's dangerous."
38,"00:07:29,037","00:07:30,830",Dangerous in what way?
39,"00:07:30,872","00:07:32,666",That goes too far.
40,"00:07:32,707","00:07:36,544","This racist propaganda, ""Mein Kampf"" psychobabble..."
41,"00:07:36,586","00:07:39,881","he learned this nonsense, and he can unlearn it, too."
42,"00:07:39,923","00:07:42,717",I will not give up on this child yet.
43,"00:08:00,276","00:08:01,611",I knew it was you.
44,"00:08:01,653","00:08:03,697","Danny, get in here."
45,"00:08:03,738","00:08:05,991",I said get in here!
46,"00:08:06,032","00:08:07,332",Get in here!
47,"00:08:07,367","00:08:10,328","Five, four, three, two..."
48,"00:08:10,370","00:08:12,247",Shut the door!
49,"00:08:15,166","00:08:16,668","What's it gonna be, Danny?"
50,"00:08:17,794","00:08:19,337",What's what gonna be?
51,"00:08:19,379","00:08:21,548",This petty crap you're pulling.
52,"00:08:23,925","00:08:25,176",I don't know.
53,"00:08:25,218","00:08:26,720",Have a seat.
54,"00:08:32,600","00:08:34,060",How are you doing?
55,"00:08:36,479","00:08:37,981",Fine.
56,"00:08:39,232","00:08:40,984",Things at home OK?
57,"00:08:46,072","00:08:48,700","Derek got out this morning, did he not?"
58,"00:08:50,869","00:08:52,711","Yeah, he did."
59,"00:08:52,746","00:08:55,749","He was one of my students. You knew that, right?"
60,"00:08:55,784","00:08:57,584",Honors English.
61,"00:08:57,625","00:09:02,317",He was a brilliant student like you...
62,"00:09:02,352","00:09:07,010","but he hung out with fools, also like you."
63,"00:09:07,052","00:09:09,179",Did you bring me in here to talk about Derek?
64,"00:09:09,220","00:09:11,723",What happened to him has nothing to do with me.
65,"00:09:11,765","00:09:15,852",Everything you do right now has something to do with Derek.
66,"00:09:15,894","00:09:18,104","I followed directions. I wrote an ""A"" Paper."
67,"00:09:18,146","00:09:20,690","""Mein Kampf""?"
68,"00:09:22,067","00:09:23,693",I should expel you.
69,"00:09:23,735","00:09:26,404",Go ahead. You don't think I could handle it?
70,"00:09:26,446","00:09:28,657",No. I think the street would kill you.
71,"00:09:28,698","00:09:30,742",Your rhetoric and your propaganda...
72,"00:09:30,784","00:09:32,911",aren't going to save you out there.
73,"00:09:34,287","00:09:35,622",So here's the drill.
74,"00:09:36,790","00:09:39,000",I'm your history teacher from now on.
75,"00:09:39,042","00:09:42,754",We will discuss current events.
76,"00:09:42,796","00:09:46,091",We will call this class...
77,"00:09:46,132","00:09:49,260",American History X.
78,"00:09:49,302","00:09:52,263",We meet once a day.
79,"00:09:52,305","00:09:54,606",All right. Your first assignment...
80,"00:09:54,641","00:09:57,108",is to prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.
81,"00:09:57,143","00:10:00,855","Come on, Sweeney. It took me a week to read ""Mein Kampf."""
82,"00:10:10,907","00:10:12,742",What do you want me to do it on?
83,"00:10:12,784","00:10:15,126",Your brother.
84,"00:10:15,161","00:10:17,288","Oh, God, man. Please tell me you're joking."
85,"00:10:17,330","00:10:19,708",No. I'm not kidding.
86,"00:10:19,749","00:10:23,294",I want you to analyze and interpret all the events...
87,"00:10:23,336","00:10:25,130",surrounding Derek's incarceration.
88,"00:10:25,171","00:10:28,925",How these events helped shape your present perspective...
89,"00:10:28,967","00:10:32,178",concerning life in contemporary America.
90,"00:10:32,220","00:10:36,057","The impact on your life, your family's."
91,"00:10:38,685","00:10:41,187","Whatever you want to say, Danny."
92,"00:10:43,773","00:10:46,776",I'll be the only one reading it.
93,"00:10:47,944","00:10:53,074",But if it's not on my desk tomorrow morning...
94,"00:10:53,116","00:10:56,494",you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.
95,"00:10:57,871","00:10:59,164",You clear?
96,"00:11:00,165","00:11:02,208","Yeah, I'm clear."
97,"00:11:07,672","00:11:09,174",Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating!
98,"00:11:09,215","00:11:10,842",Is that what's happening?
99,"00:11:12,010","00:11:13,678",I never cheated in my life.
100,"00:11:13,720","00:11:15,221",Beat his motherfucking ass.
101,"00:11:15,263","00:11:16,514",I didn't say anything!
102,"00:11:16,556","00:11:17,849",Why you tripping on me?
103,"00:11:20,268","00:11:23,480",Now why you all kicking it like that?
104,"00:11:23,521","00:11:25,363","What's up, man?"
105,"00:11:25,398","00:11:28,360",What you scared for? I ain't gonna do nothing.
106,"00:11:35,575","00:11:37,452",What's up?
107,"00:11:37,494","00:11:41,164","Want some, too, bitch? Punk, what's wrong with you?"
108,"00:11:41,206","00:11:42,624",You want to die?
109,"00:11:44,459","00:11:46,002",Punk-ass white boy.
110,"00:11:52,759","00:11:56,721",You lucky I gotta go to class. He ain't gonna do nothing.
111,"00:11:56,763","00:11:59,641",He don't wanna see me and the heater.
112,"00:12:01,393","00:12:02,644",Lucky the bell rung.
113,"00:12:02,686","00:12:04,562",I would have clocked that white boy.
114,"00:12:04,604","00:12:07,399",Punk-ass motherfucker. Should smoke that fool.
115,"00:12:08,441","00:12:10,902",You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.
116,"00:12:26,584","00:12:28,670",We got a whole file on skinheads here.
117,"00:12:28,712","00:12:30,171",Part of the same gang?
118,"00:12:30,213","00:12:31,381",Venice Beach gang.
119,"00:12:31,423","00:12:34,884","Actually, he's done a stretch at Y.A."
120,"00:12:34,926","00:12:37,804","This guy C.C., is that him?"
121,"00:12:37,846","00:12:39,889","Yeah, that's him right there."
122,"00:12:41,474","00:12:43,977","This morning we have a guest, and there he is."
123,"00:12:44,019","00:12:45,186",Good morning.
124,"00:12:45,228","00:12:46,396","Morning, sir."
125,"00:12:46,438","00:12:47,772",Good to see you.
126,"00:12:47,814","00:12:48,982",Good morning.
127,"00:12:49,024","00:12:51,067",This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
128,"00:12:51,109","00:12:53,570",He's principal over at Venice Beach High.
129,"00:12:53,611","00:12:56,031","For some time now, he's been doing outreach work..."
130,"00:12:56,072","00:12:58,491",with gangs both in and out of the can.
131,"00:12:58,533","00:13:01,453","Three years ago, a local kid named Derek Vinyard..."
132,"00:13:01,494","00:13:03,580",was sent up for murdering a couple of Crips...
133,"00:13:03,621","00:13:05,790",who were trying to jack his car.
134,"00:13:05,832","00:13:09,461","Bob taught Vinyard, and he's followed this case closely."
135,"00:13:09,502","00:13:11,803","He was a skinhead, right?"
136,"00:13:11,838","00:13:14,382","He was more like ""the"" skinhead..."
137,"00:13:14,424","00:13:16,593",the protégé of Cameron Alexander.
138,"00:13:16,635","00:13:19,220",- Who? - Cameron Alexander.
139,"00:13:19,262","00:13:22,265",Here you go. Have a look-see.
140,"00:13:22,307","00:13:26,061","Cameron Alexander, well, he's a Venice Beach landmark."
141,"00:13:26,102","00:13:27,896",He's the biggest distributor and writer...
142,"00:13:27,937","00:13:30,398",of White Power literature and videos in L.A. County.
143,"00:13:30,440","00:13:33,526","He promotes White Power bands, he writes reviews..."
144,"00:13:33,568","00:13:36,655","and in his spare time, this guy even writes hate columns."
145,"00:13:36,696","00:13:39,491",- Does he have a record? - He's pretty clean.
146,"00:13:39,532","00:13:42,160","Been trying to pin something to him, but it doesn't work."
147,"00:13:42,202","00:13:44,829",Trust me. He's behind all of it.
148,"00:13:44,871","00:13:47,624",He runs everything out of his house by the beach.
149,"00:13:47,666","00:13:50,293",There were no white gangs in Venice Beach...
150,"00:13:50,335","00:13:52,587",before Cameron Alexander and Derek Vinyard hooked up.
151,"00:13:52,629","00:13:55,548",Alexander found in Derek his shining prince.
152,"00:13:55,583","00:13:58,468","Essentially, he used Derek to recruit..."
153,"00:13:58,510","00:14:02,472","a slew of insecure, frustrated, and impressionable kids."
154,"00:14:02,514","00:14:05,600","This kid Vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage..."
155,"00:14:05,642","00:14:09,604",as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of NBC.
156,"00:14:16,236","00:14:18,738","Earlier today, L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard..."
157,"00:14:18,780","00:14:21,408",was shot and killed battling a blaze...
158,"00:14:21,449","00:14:23,326",at a suspected Compton drug den.
159,"00:14:23,368","00:14:25,203",We're at the Vinyard home now...
160,"00:14:25,245","00:14:27,163",and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek...
161,"00:14:27,205","00:14:29,290",has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
162,"00:14:29,332","00:14:32,711","Derek, if you could come down here please for a second."
163,"00:14:32,752","00:14:37,757","Look, I know this is tough, but how do you feel right now?"
164,"00:14:37,799","00:14:40,260",How do you think I feel?
165,"00:14:40,302","00:14:43,228",- I think it's typical. - Typical how?
166,"00:14:43,263","00:14:46,891","Well, this country's becoming a haven for criminals..."
167,"00:14:46,933","00:14:48,393",so what do you expect?
168,"00:14:48,435","00:14:50,603",Decent hard-working Americans like my dad...
169,"00:14:50,645","00:14:53,648",are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
170,"00:14:53,690","00:14:55,025",Parasites?
171,"00:14:55,066","00:14:59,279","Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever."
172,"00:14:59,321","00:15:00,864",I don't understand.
173,"00:15:00,905","00:15:02,907",You think maybe your father's murder was race-related?
174,"00:15:02,949","00:15:04,868","Yeah, it's race-related."
175,"00:15:04,909","00:15:06,786",Every problem in this country is race-related.
176,"00:15:06,828","00:15:09,831","Not just crime. It's immigration, AIDS, welfare."
177,"00:15:09,866","00:15:12,834",Those are problems of the black community...
178,"00:15:12,876","00:15:14,669","the Hispanic community, the Asian community."
179,"00:15:14,711","00:15:16,087",They're not white problems.
180,"00:15:16,129","00:15:18,548",Aren't those really issues that deal more with poverty?
181,"00:15:18,590","00:15:22,427",No. They're not products of their environments.
182,"00:15:22,469","00:15:24,304",Minorities don't give two shits about this country.
183,"00:15:24,346","00:15:27,606","They come here to exploit it, not to embrace it."
184,"00:15:27,641","00:15:30,352",Millions of white Europeans came here and flourished...
185,"00:15:30,393","00:15:31,770",within a generation.
186,"00:15:31,811","00:15:34,189",What the fuck is the matter with these people?
187,"00:15:34,230","00:15:36,274",They have to go around shooting at firemen.
188,"00:15:36,316","00:15:39,277",What does this have to do with the murder of your father?
189,"00:15:39,319","00:15:41,738",Because my father was murdered doing his job!
190,"00:15:41,780","00:15:44,157",Putting out a fire in a fucking nigger neighborhood...
191,"00:15:44,199","00:15:45,992",he shouldn't have given a shit about.
192,"00:15:46,034","00:15:48,244",He got shot by a fucking drug dealer...
193,"00:15:48,286","00:15:50,747",who probably still collects a welfare check.
194,"00:15:50,789","00:15:53,708",Derek Vinyard was quietly released from Chino...
195,"00:15:53,750","00:15:57,045",early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
196,"00:15:57,087","00:15:59,839",I think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
197,"00:15:59,881","00:16:01,466",If something happens to him...
198,"00:16:01,508","00:16:04,469",things could get very ugly down by the beach.
199,"00:16:04,511","00:16:05,845",Just keep it low.
200,"00:16:07,138","00:16:10,266",Venice Beach didn't always look like this.
201,"00:16:10,308","00:16:12,852",It used to be a great neighborhood.
202,"00:16:12,894","00:16:14,896",The boardwalk's always been a dump...
203,"00:16:14,938","00:16:17,107",but when my dad moved us out here...
204,"00:16:17,148","00:16:19,567","Venice was a nice, quiet place to grow up."
205,"00:16:21,569","00:16:24,197","Over the years, though, it's just gone to hell."
206,"00:16:24,239","00:16:26,199",The gangs are like a plague.
207,"00:16:26,241","00:16:29,536",They moved west from Inglewood and South Central...
208,"00:16:29,577","00:16:30,954",and basically took over.
209,"00:16:30,996","00:16:32,372",I ain't fouling you!
210,"00:16:39,546","00:16:42,007",I ain't got time for all this bullshit.
211,"00:16:42,048","00:16:43,425",Fuck y'all.
212,"00:16:43,466","00:16:44,592",You all right?
213,"00:16:44,634","00:16:45,802",I'm all right.
214,"00:16:47,345","00:16:50,307","Yo, is that that fool you was telling me about?"
215,"00:16:51,391","00:16:53,310","Yeah, that's that motherfucker."
216,"00:16:58,732","00:17:00,942","Yeah, man, that's him."
217,"00:17:10,201","00:17:12,037",Bitch-ass motherfucker.
218,"00:17:12,078","00:17:14,205",That's why Derek started the D.O.C.
219,"00:17:14,247","00:17:17,375",He said white kids shouldn't have to walk around scared...
220,"00:17:17,417","00:17:19,878","in their own neighborhood, and for a while there..."
221,"00:17:19,919","00:17:22,756",we really made it like it was ours again.
222,"00:17:22,797","00:17:25,383",Throw the ball!
223,"00:17:25,425","00:17:27,052","Come on, Curtis!"
224,"00:17:27,093","00:17:29,012",Quit chucking it up. Pass the ball.
225,"00:17:30,972","00:17:32,724","""D"" up!"
226,"00:17:32,766","00:17:34,100","Come on, let's go."
227,"00:17:34,934","00:17:36,686",Look at this fucking jungle bunny.
228,"00:17:36,728","00:17:39,522",He does a spin move every time.
229,"00:17:40,774","00:17:42,942","You ain't getting shit, motherfucker."
230,"00:17:44,569","00:17:46,738","This one's for you, boy!"
231,"00:17:46,780","00:17:47,989",What the fuck you-
232,"00:17:49,282","00:17:50,867","Who you calling boy, motherfucker?"
233,"00:17:50,909","00:17:52,118","You're lucky, motherfucker!"
234,"00:17:52,160","00:17:54,287",I'm through monkeying around with your fucking ass!
235,"00:17:54,329","00:17:56,956","Pale, pasty, pastrami-eating, cracker motherfucker."
236,"00:17:56,998","00:17:59,084",A hundred bucks say I make you my bitch.
237,"00:18:01,586","00:18:04,089",Hear that? He's trying to make ends meet...
238,"00:18:04,130","00:18:06,049",for his cut in welfare. You're on!
239,"00:18:07,842","00:18:09,094","It's eight-six, Seth."
240,"00:18:09,135","00:18:11,304","When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it."
241,"00:18:11,346","00:18:13,932",Come on. I can't cover this. Help me out here.
242,"00:18:13,974","00:18:15,704",You got a big fucking mouth.
243,"00:18:15,739","00:18:17,435",I can take this niglet down.
244,"00:18:17,477","00:18:19,980",You couldn't take a shit. What are you thinking?
245,"00:18:20,021","00:18:21,564",I will beat him. Give me the money.
246,"00:18:21,606","00:18:22,774",Shut up.
247,"00:18:22,816","00:18:24,651",You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
248,"00:18:32,784","00:18:34,828",I'll take care of this.
249,"00:18:34,869","00:18:36,830","Yo, I ain't got time for this."
250,"00:18:36,865","00:18:37,998",Hey!
251,"00:18:39,207","00:18:40,500",I got a bet.
252,"00:18:41,668","00:18:44,629",I come in this game right now. Same score...
253,"00:18:44,671","00:18:47,173",but we play black guys against the white guys.
254,"00:18:52,429","00:18:54,514","Name your price, cracker."
255,"00:18:54,556","00:18:56,933",No money. For these courts.
256,"00:18:56,975","00:18:58,852",And not just today. For good.
257,"00:18:58,893","00:19:00,979","If you win, we will walk away..."
258,"00:19:01,021","00:19:04,899","but if we win, no bitching, no fighting."
259,"00:19:04,941","00:19:07,944","Right here in front of everybody, pack up your shit..."
260,"00:19:07,986","00:19:09,988",and get your black asses out of here.
261,"00:19:10,030","00:19:11,698",Fuck that. Take this bet.
262,"00:19:11,740","00:19:13,241",Eight to six. Our ball.
263,"00:19:13,283","00:19:14,993",Let's go.
264,"00:19:30,383","00:19:31,843",Pick him up!
265,"00:19:38,892","00:19:40,935","Seth, get back and play some ""D."""
266,"00:19:57,077","00:19:58,244",Defense!
267,"00:20:06,378","00:20:08,672",Pass the fucking ball! I was wide open!
268,"00:20:24,104","00:20:25,438",Bullshit. That's fucking offense.
269,"00:20:25,480","00:20:27,232",Get out of here. He moved his feet.
270,"00:20:27,273","00:20:30,276","You want to go, I'm ready! Don't throw elbows at me!"
271,"00:20:30,318","00:20:32,696","You want to go, Adolf Hitler wannabe motherfucker?"
272,"00:20:43,999","00:20:46,626",- You OK? - Yeah. Give me some water.
273,"00:20:46,668","00:20:48,753",You gotta call offense on that shit.
274,"00:20:48,795","00:20:50,588","Not on game point, Danny."
275,"00:20:50,630","00:20:52,799",You can't let those niggers get away with that shit.
276,"00:20:52,841","00:20:54,009",It's game point.
277,"00:20:54,050","00:20:55,760",Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.
278,"00:20:55,802","00:20:58,138",Watch this.
279,"00:21:51,691","00:21:52,984",Bye-bye.
280,"00:21:53,026","00:21:54,861",Get the fuck off my court!
281,"00:21:54,903","00:21:56,154",This is my house!
282,"00:21:56,196","00:21:57,530","Fuck you, bitch!"
283,"00:22:09,542","00:22:11,503",Get the fuck out of here!
284,"00:22:11,544","00:22:13,046",This is my court!
285,"00:22:23,306","00:22:26,017",Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.
286,"00:22:26,059","00:22:28,770",He said it would make it just too hard for him...
287,"00:22:28,812","00:22:31,856","and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow."
288,"00:22:31,898","00:22:34,693","Three years without him, just wondering."
289,"00:22:37,278","00:22:39,864",And then at 7:00 this morning...
290,"00:22:39,906","00:22:42,534",we picked him up outside the gate.
291,"00:22:48,832","00:22:51,793","The whole ride back, he didn't say anything."
292,"00:22:51,835","00:22:53,336","I wanted to stay home, but he said..."
293,"00:22:53,378","00:22:55,046","""No. Go to school. I'll see you later."""
294,"00:23:09,561","00:23:12,404","Oh, come on. Give the guy a break."
295,"00:23:12,439","00:23:15,358","What? You too big to give me a hug, tough guy?"
296,"00:23:15,400","00:23:17,444","No, man. I just know you're gonna need someone..."
297,"00:23:17,485","00:23:19,362",to look after you while you adjust to all this space.
298,"00:23:19,404","00:23:20,613","Yeah, right."
299,"00:23:22,240","00:23:24,409",This place is smaller than the old living room.
300,"00:23:24,451","00:23:26,119",How you doing? How's school?
301,"00:23:26,161","00:23:27,746",It's good.
302,"00:23:27,787","00:23:29,789",You gotta do something about that hair.
303,"00:23:29,831","00:23:31,291",That do's has gotta go.
304,"00:23:31,333","00:23:33,918","- The girls like it. - Well, I don't."
305,"00:23:33,960","00:23:37,380",You're keeping it pretty close. You took it all the way down.
306,"00:23:38,340","00:23:40,383","Shit. Look. I forgot, man."
307,"00:23:41,635","00:23:43,887",It hurt like shit when they put it on.
308,"00:23:43,928","00:23:45,847",When'd you get that?
309,"00:23:45,889","00:23:48,099",I got it about a month ago.
310,"00:23:48,141","00:23:49,851",Cameron made it official.
311,"00:23:53,813","00:23:55,523",He put this on you?
312,"00:24:01,529","00:24:02,656",What?
313,"00:24:02,697","00:24:04,761","Oh, hi. He's here."
314,"00:24:04,796","00:24:06,826","Derek, it's for you."
315,"00:24:06,868","00:24:09,245",Nothing.
316,"00:24:09,287","00:24:12,123",Is there a phone in the back? I'll get it in the back.
317,"00:24:20,215","00:24:23,259",I got it. Yeah?
318,"00:24:23,301","00:24:24,427","Oh, hey."
319,"00:24:27,055","00:24:28,598",What?
320,"00:24:28,640","00:24:31,142",My eyes have seen the glory...
321,"00:24:31,184","00:24:33,228",of the trampling at the zoo.
322,"00:24:33,269","00:24:36,272",We've washed ourselves in nigger's blood...
323,"00:24:36,314","00:24:38,817","and all the mongrels, too."
324,"00:24:38,858","00:24:41,569",We're taking down the Zog machine...
325,"00:24:41,611","00:24:43,697",Jew by Jew by Jew.
326,"00:24:43,738","00:24:47,666",The white man marches on.
327,"00:24:47,701","00:24:50,704",You think our friend was behind that?
328,"00:24:52,205","00:24:53,748",I don't even care.
329,"00:24:53,790","00:24:55,959",I'm gonna take care of that tonight.
330,"00:24:56,001","00:25:00,046",My sweet kids. My baby boy.
331,"00:25:00,088","00:25:02,966","God, what's with the love fest, you guys?"
332,"00:25:08,054","00:25:11,516",No. He'll do it. I'll make sure he does it.
333,"00:25:11,558","00:25:13,184",I'll get it.
334,"00:25:20,066","00:25:21,735",I came to see the man.
335,"00:25:21,776","00:25:25,071",- Can you fit through the door? - Fuck you!
336,"00:25:27,032","00:25:29,534","What's up, Dan? How you doing?"
337,"00:25:29,576","00:25:32,078",- Where's Derek? - He's on the phone.
338,"00:25:32,120","00:25:35,498","Come out, you free motherfucker! Where the fuck are you?"
339,"00:25:35,540","00:25:38,835",Hang on. Give me a minute.
340,"00:25:39,961","00:25:41,921",I'll be out in a minute.
341,"00:25:56,478","00:25:57,854",I'll be careful.
342,"00:25:57,896","00:26:01,650",I'm not gonna stay in my room the rest of my life.
343,"00:26:01,691","00:26:03,485",Hold on.
344,"00:26:03,526","00:26:06,946",Hey. What the fuck is Seth doing here?
345,"00:26:06,988","00:26:08,823",Did you invite him over?
346,"00:26:08,865","00:26:11,034",No. He always comes over here.
347,"00:26:12,661","00:26:15,080","Danny, give me a minute."
348,"00:26:15,121","00:26:17,290",Just give me one minute.
349,"00:26:36,977","00:26:38,979","Are you still here, Goodyear?"
350,"00:26:40,397","00:26:43,316","You calling me a blimp, you fucking Democrat?"
351,"00:26:44,484","00:26:47,821",When was the last time you were actually able to see your feet?
352,"00:26:50,532","00:26:52,117","Come in here, Danny."
353,"00:26:56,955","00:26:59,332",Are you going to Cam's party tonight?
354,"00:26:59,367","00:27:01,668",Is Davina's ass watertight?
355,"00:27:01,710","00:27:03,586","You're fucking sick, man."
356,"00:27:03,628","00:27:06,631","All right, relax. Let me ask you a few questions."
357,"00:27:06,673","00:27:08,925",I'm not in the mood. I got homework.
358,"00:27:08,967","00:27:11,803","Tell me some of the shit you've learned, fuck-ass..."
359,"00:27:11,845","00:27:13,471",before I pistol-whip you.
360,"00:27:13,513","00:27:16,599","OK. I believe in death, destruction..."
361,"00:27:16,641","00:27:18,810","chaos, filth, and greed."
362,"00:27:18,852","00:27:22,605","Cut the shit, Dan. Come on. Tell me what I want to hear."
363,"00:27:23,690","00:27:25,650",You mean that shit about your mother?
364,"00:27:25,692","00:27:28,528","You want to get fucking beaten, Danny?"
365,"00:27:30,196","00:27:33,658",I'm not fucking talking to you. Shut up.
366,"00:27:33,700","00:27:36,411","Look, you gotta let me do this my own way, all right?"
367,"00:27:38,163","00:27:39,831",I'll take care of it.
368,"00:27:39,873","00:27:41,833","Who do you hate, Danny?"
369,"00:27:41,875","00:27:45,003",I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.
370,"00:27:45,045","00:27:46,004",Why?
371,"00:27:46,046","00:27:48,673",They're a burden to the advancement of the white race.
372,"00:27:48,715","00:27:50,008",Some are all right.
373,"00:27:50,050","00:27:52,844","None of them are fucking all right, OK?"
374,"00:27:52,879","00:27:55,639",They're all a bunch of fucking freeloaders.
375,"00:27:55,680","00:27:58,058",We don't know 'em. We don't want to know 'em.
376,"00:27:58,093","00:27:59,309",They're the fucking enemy.
377,"00:28:01,770","00:28:03,521",What don't you like about them...
378,"00:28:03,563","00:28:05,482",and say it with some fucking conviction.
379,"00:28:05,523","00:28:08,735",I hate the fact it's cool to be black these days.
380,"00:28:08,777","00:28:09,903",Good.
381,"00:28:09,944","00:28:14,032",I hate this hip-hop influence on white fucking suburbia.
382,"00:28:14,074","00:28:15,617",Good.
383,"00:28:15,659","00:28:19,788",I hate Tabitha Soren and her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...
384,"00:28:19,829","00:28:21,414",telling us we should get along.
385,"00:28:21,456","00:28:24,584","Save the rhetorical bullshit, Hillary Rodham Clinton..."
386,"00:28:24,626","00:28:26,378",'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
387,"00:28:26,419","00:28:28,546",That's some of the best shit I've ever heard.
388,"00:28:28,588","00:28:32,217","I feel sorry for you, Danny."
389,"00:28:32,258","00:28:34,386","You don't believe any of that shit, right?"
390,"00:28:34,427","00:28:35,553",Shut up.
391,"00:28:35,595","00:28:39,182","No. Get out of the house now, you piece of shit."
392,"00:28:39,224","00:28:41,935","Is that any way to talk to a guest, a friend?"
393,"00:28:41,977","00:28:44,145","Derek hates you, and you don't realize it."
394,"00:28:44,187","00:28:46,731",How do you know who I hate?
395,"00:28:46,773","00:28:50,110",Back from the dead. God bless Jesus Christ.
396,"00:28:50,151","00:28:52,570","God, I think you lost weight."
397,"00:28:52,612","00:28:54,781",I can get my arms almost all the way around you.
398,"00:28:54,823","00:28:58,910","Fifty fucking pounds, man. Look at this hair. Holy shit."
399,"00:28:58,952","00:29:02,080",I told him it's gotta go.
400,"00:29:02,122","00:29:04,249",Grab your jacket. Let's get the fuck out of here.
401,"00:29:04,291","00:29:08,420",I want to talk to him. One second.
402,"00:29:08,461","00:29:13,383","Hey, listen. Did you pull some shit in school today?"
403,"00:29:13,425","00:29:16,594",- Just the usual. - This kid is awesome as hell.
404,"00:29:16,636","00:29:19,556","Did you turn in a paper on ""Mein Kampf""?"
405,"00:29:20,849","00:29:24,102","- Sweeney shit his pants. - He did, man."
406,"00:29:24,144","00:29:27,188",Was that your idea or did Cameron put you up to that?
407,"00:29:27,230","00:29:30,066",No. I thought it would be cool. How'd you know?
408,"00:29:30,108","00:29:32,277",It doesn't matter how I knew.
409,"00:29:32,319","00:29:34,612",This kid is smart as hell.
410,"00:29:34,654","00:29:36,656",Was that Sweeney on the phone?
411,"00:29:36,698","00:29:38,575",Sweeney called and told me.
412,"00:29:38,616","00:29:41,619","God, I hate that fucking nigger, man."
413,"00:29:41,661","00:29:43,121",He's gotta get a fucking life.
414,"00:29:44,372","00:29:46,082",Sweeney's a good teacher.
415,"00:29:46,124","00:29:48,293",Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip.
416,"00:29:48,335","00:29:50,378",That's what he was like when we were there...
417,"00:29:50,420","00:29:52,922",and that's how he is now. It'll never change.
418,"00:29:52,964","00:29:54,132",Fuck that nigger!
419,"00:29:54,174","00:29:56,259","- Seth, go away. - Are you kidding?"
420,"00:29:56,301","00:29:59,638",Nope. Wait in Danny's room. I want to talk to my brother.
421,"00:29:59,679","00:30:02,515",I've been here 15 minutes. I'm starving.
422,"00:30:06,728","00:30:10,607","Come here. Seriously, look. Forget this yahoo."
423,"00:30:10,649","00:30:13,568",He kills bugs for a living. You don't want to be like that.
424,"00:30:13,610","00:30:15,153",I'm serious. It's not funny.
425,"00:30:15,195","00:30:17,530",Sweeney is a good teacher. You can learn a lot from him.
426,"00:30:17,572","00:30:20,784",Don't go fuck it up with small fry shit like that.
427,"00:30:20,825","00:30:22,167",You don't understand.
428,"00:30:22,202","00:30:24,329",You got to see the bullshit paper he's making me write.
429,"00:30:24,371","00:30:26,915",He told me all about it. I don't care.
430,"00:30:26,957","00:30:29,668",You do anything he tells you to do. I mean it.
431,"00:30:29,709","00:30:31,795",I don't want you getting in trouble in school...
432,"00:30:31,836","00:30:35,215","trying to impress me, taking this shit in there."
433,"00:30:35,250","00:30:37,008",Do you understand what I'm saying?
434,"00:30:37,050","00:30:40,762","Yeah, I guess, but, I mean, I thought you'd be happy."
435,"00:30:40,804","00:30:42,222","Well, I'm not."
436,"00:30:44,724","00:30:46,059",Listen to that.
437,"00:30:46,935","00:30:50,021","Yeah, I know. It's been getting worse."
438,"00:30:50,063","00:30:51,439",Don't worry about it.
439,"00:30:51,481","00:30:53,400",I'll talk to you about this later.
440,"00:30:56,403","00:30:58,279",She's coughing her lungs out...
441,"00:30:58,321","00:31:00,949",and you're blowing this in her face all day.
442,"00:31:00,991","00:31:02,200",I'm putting it out.
443,"00:31:02,242","00:31:05,704","Hey, come on. I want to talk to you."
444,"00:31:10,083","00:31:13,086","Mommy, are you OK?"
445,"00:31:18,925","00:31:20,635",Put that out.
446,"00:31:20,677","00:31:23,888",I was just yelling at him for blowing smoke in your face.
447,"00:31:23,930","00:31:26,141","Nice thing to come home to, huh?"
448,"00:31:28,685","00:31:29,978",You all right?
449,"00:31:30,979","00:31:32,188",You all right?
450,"00:31:38,320","00:31:40,822","Look, you got to take it easy."
451,"00:31:40,864","00:31:42,747",You got to get some rest.
452,"00:31:42,782","00:31:44,909","Take Danny's and my room, and we'll hit the couch."
453,"00:31:44,951","00:31:47,871",I've been on the couch for ages. The couch is fine.
454,"00:31:47,912","00:31:49,754","No, it's not fine. This is terrible."
455,"00:31:49,789","00:31:53,585",We can't live like this. We gotta get out of here.
456,"00:31:55,712","00:31:57,881",Can I go with you?
457,"00:31:57,922","00:32:01,217",Yeah. We all gotta get out of here.
458,"00:32:01,259","00:32:04,763",- I could drop out and get a job. - Absolutely not.
459,"00:32:04,804","00:32:06,806",You got to finish. I'll work something out.
460,"00:32:10,393","00:32:15,231","Derek, can we please go eat? I'm fucking starving here."
461,"00:32:15,273","00:32:17,067",Go wait in the living room.
462,"00:32:18,234","00:32:20,403",I want him out of my house.
463,"00:32:20,445","00:32:21,946",I know. Look.
464,"00:32:37,170","00:32:40,027",He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot.
465,"00:32:40,062","00:32:42,884",He can't help it. I got to do that paper.
466,"00:32:42,926","00:32:45,261",I'll catch up with you later tonight.
467,"00:32:45,303","00:32:48,431",Not at Cameron's. I need you to stay away from there.
468,"00:32:48,473","00:32:51,935",- We were going to hang. - I'll explain it later.
469,"00:32:51,977","00:32:54,437","I just need you to stay away from the party, all right?"
470,"00:32:54,479","00:32:55,605",Whatever.
471,"00:32:55,647","00:32:59,234",Promise me you'll stay away from that party tonight.
472,"00:32:59,275","00:33:01,528","I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?"
473,"00:33:02,737","00:33:04,030",Whatever.
474,"00:33:06,032","00:33:06,992",God!
475,"00:33:13,123","00:33:14,833","Come on, let's go."
476,"00:33:16,459","00:33:17,752",Where are you parked?
477,"00:33:17,794","00:33:19,045",Out back.
478,"00:34:28,073","00:34:29,783","Yeah, that's the whole bunch."
479,"00:34:31,201","00:34:34,120",It didn't take long for Derek to make a name for himself...
480,"00:34:34,155","00:34:36,247",and Cameron knew just how to use it.
481,"00:34:36,289","00:34:37,624",You don't want to stick around?
482,"00:34:37,666","00:34:41,753","You know I'd love to, but I got to be careful."
483,"00:34:41,795","00:34:43,797","Yeah, I know."
484,"00:34:44,464","00:34:46,341",I'll see you back at the house.
485,"00:34:47,759","00:34:49,100",Good luck.
486,"00:34:49,135","00:34:53,098","He sent Derek to the kids, to the frustrated ones..."
487,"00:34:53,139","00:34:54,975",the ones who were sick of getting their asses kicked...
488,"00:34:55,016","00:34:57,435",by black and Mexican gangs.
489,"00:34:57,477","00:35:00,313","""Don't just be some punk. Be part of something."""
490,"00:35:00,355","00:35:03,233","All right, let's go. Pull it together."
491,"00:35:03,274","00:35:04,943",And everybody ate it up.
492,"00:35:04,985","00:35:07,404",They did whatever Derek told them to.
493,"00:35:08,405","00:35:10,699",Let's go. We're not here to fucking socialize.
494,"00:35:12,492","00:35:13,743",Shut the fuck up.
495,"00:35:13,785","00:35:14,995","Yeah, man."
496,"00:35:15,036","00:35:16,371",You want a little toke?
497,"00:35:17,831","00:35:19,249",Go ahead.
498,"00:35:19,291","00:35:21,876","- Curtis, what is that? - Come on, Derek."
499,"00:35:21,918","00:35:24,671",Weed is for niggers. Put that away right now.
500,"00:35:24,713","00:35:25,964",Jesus fucking Christ.
501,"00:35:26,006","00:35:27,424",Have a little self-respect.
502,"00:35:28,883","00:35:32,846","All right, listen up. We need to open our eyes."
503,"00:35:34,180","00:35:36,766",There's over two million illegal immigrants...
504,"00:35:36,808","00:35:39,311",bedding down in this state tonight.
505,"00:35:40,770","00:35:44,316",This state spent three billion dollars last year...
506,"00:35:44,357","00:35:47,694",on services for those people who had no right to be here.
507,"00:35:47,736","00:35:49,321",Three billion dollars.
508,"00:35:49,362","00:35:53,867",$400 million just to lock up illegal immigrant criminals...
509,"00:35:53,908","00:35:57,829",who only got into this country because the INS decided...
510,"00:35:57,864","00:36:01,750",it's not worth the effort to screen for convicted felons.
511,"00:36:03,752","00:36:06,212",Our government doesn't give a shit.
512,"00:36:07,714","00:36:12,052","Our border policy is a joke, so is anybody surprised..."
513,"00:36:12,093","00:36:14,387",that south of the border they're laughing at us?
514,"00:36:14,429","00:36:16,681",Laughing at our laws?
515,"00:36:16,723","00:36:18,516","Every night, thousands of these parasites..."
516,"00:36:18,558","00:36:21,436",stream across the border like some fucking piñata exploded.
517,"00:36:21,478","00:36:25,106",Don't laugh. There's nothing funny here.
518,"00:36:25,148","00:36:27,192",This is about your life and mine.
519,"00:36:28,568","00:36:30,695","It's about decent, hard-working Americans..."
520,"00:36:30,737","00:36:32,572",falling through the cracks and getting the shaft...
521,"00:36:32,614","00:36:36,076",because their government cares more about the rights...
522,"00:36:36,111","00:36:38,370",of a bunch of people who aren't even citizens.
523,"00:36:38,411","00:36:40,455",On the Statue of Liberty it says...
524,"00:36:40,497","00:36:43,208","""Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."""
525,"00:36:43,249","00:36:45,877","Well, it's Americans who are tired and hungry and poor."
526,"00:36:45,919","00:36:48,088",Until you take care of that...
527,"00:36:48,129","00:36:51,132","close the fucking book, because we're losing."
528,"00:36:52,217","00:36:55,679",We're losing our right to pursue our destiny.
529,"00:36:55,720","00:36:59,140",We're losing our freedom so a bunch of fucking foreigners...
530,"00:36:59,182","00:37:01,351",can come in here and exploit our country.
531,"00:37:01,393","00:37:04,479",And this isn't something that's going on far away.
532,"00:37:04,521","00:37:07,565",This isn't happening places we can't do anything about it.
533,"00:37:07,607","00:37:10,068",It's happening here. Right in our neighborhood.
534,"00:37:10,110","00:37:12,195",Right in that building behind you.
535,"00:37:12,237","00:37:15,699",Archie Miller ran that grocery store since we were kids here.
536,"00:37:15,740","00:37:18,583",Dave worked there. Mike worked there.
537,"00:37:18,618","00:37:20,996","He went under, and now some fucking Korean owns it..."
538,"00:37:21,037","00:37:23,540",who fired these guys and is making a killing...
539,"00:37:23,581","00:37:26,918",because he hired 40 fucking border jumpers.
540,"00:37:26,960","00:37:28,336",I see this shit going on...
541,"00:37:28,378","00:37:30,380",and I don't see anybody doing anything about it...
542,"00:37:30,422","00:37:32,299",and it fucking pisses me off.
543,"00:37:34,467","00:37:36,428",So look around you.
544,"00:37:37,679","00:37:38,805",This isn't our fucking neighborhood.
545,"00:37:38,847","00:37:41,599",It's a battlefield. We're on a battlefield tonight.
546,"00:37:41,641","00:37:43,310",Make a decision.
547,"00:37:43,351","00:37:46,021",Are we going to stand on the sidelines?
548,"00:37:46,062","00:37:48,732",Quietly standing there while our country gets raped?
549,"00:37:49,774","00:37:52,652",Are we going to ante up and do something about it?
550,"00:37:54,112","00:37:55,488",You're goddamn right.
551,"00:38:08,126","00:38:10,754",Come here! Don't you know it's illegal...
552,"00:38:10,795","00:38:13,423","to hire fucking border jumpers, you nip bastard?"
553,"00:38:21,181","00:38:22,641","Hey, sweetheart."
554,"00:38:22,682","00:38:24,851",No. You don't need this. We're not going to hurt you.
555,"00:38:24,893","00:38:26,478","Please, please! No!"
556,"00:38:29,439","00:38:30,649",You fucking spic!
557,"00:38:33,568","00:38:36,237",- No! Please! - This bitch deserves it.
558,"00:38:36,279","00:38:40,533",This bitch stinks. Smells like fish and chips and guacamole.
559,"00:38:40,575","00:38:42,035",Here we go.
560,"00:38:53,046","00:38:54,798",Goddamn!
561,"00:38:58,802","00:39:00,512","Get the fuck off me, motherfucker!"
562,"00:39:07,852","00:39:09,396",Viva la Mexico!
563,"00:39:14,234","00:39:16,236","Have a fucking bean, you fucking beaner!"
564,"00:39:23,910","00:39:27,205",Get some of that in there. Throw it on.
565,"00:39:27,247","00:39:29,124",That's a great color on you.
566,"00:39:29,165","00:39:31,084",Now you can get a white woman's job.
567,"00:39:31,126","00:39:33,128","A little better than this one, huh?"
568,"00:39:33,169","00:39:34,754","Yeah, white."
569,"00:39:34,796","00:39:36,631",Then you'll move up in the world.
570,"00:39:38,341","00:39:39,634",Asshole!
571,"00:39:41,594","00:39:42,721",Let's go!
572,"00:39:42,762","00:39:44,347",Everybody out!
573,"00:39:44,389","00:39:45,890",Now! Now!
574,"00:39:48,852","00:39:50,729","All right, let's go!"
575,"00:39:50,770","00:39:52,230",Come on!
576,"00:39:52,272","00:39:53,857","Come on, let's go."
577,"00:39:59,029","00:40:02,365","No green card, no fucking work. Comprende?"
578,"00:40:04,784","00:40:05,910",Come on!
579,"00:40:05,952","00:40:07,954",We're fucking going! Come on!
580,"00:40:34,314","00:40:38,234","Dad was gone, but things were almost normal again."
581,"00:40:38,276","00:40:39,986",Derek had a good job.
582,"00:40:40,028","00:40:41,780",Mom was starting to live a little.
583,"00:40:41,821","00:40:46,117","Everyone was feeling so good, we just didn't see it coming."
584,"00:40:46,159","00:40:47,869",Maybe we should've.
585,"00:40:47,911","00:40:50,205",The irony is that most of the stores...
586,"00:40:50,246","00:40:52,832",destroyed during the riots were owned by black people.
587,"00:40:52,874","00:40:55,961","That's stupid, though. Why trash your own neighborhood?"
588,"00:40:56,002","00:40:59,005","Well, that's my point. It's an irrational act."
589,"00:40:59,040","00:41:01,132",It's like an expression of rage...
590,"00:41:01,174","00:41:05,136",by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.
591,"00:41:05,178","00:41:10,725",It's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68.
592,"00:41:10,767","00:41:12,310",I don't buy that.
593,"00:41:12,352","00:41:14,813",Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage.
594,"00:41:14,854","00:41:17,732",That's such a cop-out. It's opportunism at its worst.
595,"00:41:17,774","00:41:19,985",It's people grabbing any excuse they can find...
596,"00:41:20,026","00:41:21,861","to go and loot a store, nothing more."
597,"00:41:21,903","00:41:24,197",The fact that these people ripped off the stores...
598,"00:41:24,239","00:41:26,199","in their own communities, all that reflects..."
599,"00:41:26,241","00:41:29,202",is that they have no respect for the law at all...
600,"00:41:29,237","00:41:31,830",and certainly no concept of community...
601,"00:41:31,871","00:41:33,540",or civic responsibility.
602,"00:41:33,581","00:41:34,749",Now wait a minute.
603,"00:41:34,791","00:41:37,335","White people commit crimes against white people, too."
604,"00:41:37,377","00:41:40,839","Yeah, but they're not offing each other in record numbers."
605,"00:41:40,880","00:41:42,841","Look at the statistics, for Christ's sake."
606,"00:41:42,882","00:41:45,010",One in every three black males...
607,"00:41:45,051","00:41:47,387",is in some phase of the correctional system.
608,"00:41:47,429","00:41:48,680",Is that a coincidence...
609,"00:41:48,722","00:41:51,558",or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
610,"00:41:51,599","00:41:53,893",Not only that. They're proud of it.
611,"00:41:53,935","00:41:56,062",Maybe it says something about prejudice...
612,"00:41:56,104","00:41:57,272",in the judicial system.
613,"00:41:57,314","00:41:59,566",If you want to talk about criminal statistics...
614,"00:41:59,607","00:42:03,111",take a look at the social inequalities that produce them.
615,"00:42:03,153","00:42:05,196",That's exactly what I hate.
616,"00:42:05,238","00:42:08,325",You're taking one thing and calling it something else...
617,"00:42:08,366","00:42:10,744",and just alleviating the responsibility...
618,"00:42:10,785","00:42:12,370",these people have for their own actions.
619,"00:42:12,412","00:42:15,790","It's like saying, it's not a riot, it's rage."
620,"00:42:15,832","00:42:19,377","It's not crime, it's poverty. That's just nonsense."
621,"00:42:19,419","00:42:21,338",It's exactly what happened in this trial...
622,"00:42:21,379","00:42:23,131",because the media twisted things around...
623,"00:42:23,173","00:42:25,842",so people got all focused on these cops...
624,"00:42:25,884","00:42:27,218",and whether or not they were going to get convicted...
625,"00:42:27,260","00:42:30,388",and whether Rodney King's civil rights had been violated.
626,"00:42:30,430","00:42:32,641",Everybody lost sight of old Rodney King himself.
627,"00:42:32,682","00:42:35,769",The guy's a multiple felon by his own admission.
628,"00:42:35,810","00:42:37,646",He's high as a goddamn kite...
629,"00:42:37,687","00:42:40,357",driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
630,"00:42:40,398","00:42:42,400",He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops...
631,"00:42:42,442","00:42:43,902",and he attacks them.
632,"00:42:43,943","00:42:45,236",He attacked police officers.
633,"00:42:45,278","00:42:46,745","That's the bottom line, and he walked."
634,"00:42:46,780","00:42:49,115",And there's some yahoo there with a video camera...
635,"00:42:49,157","00:42:50,533",who turned it on halfway through...
636,"00:42:50,575","00:42:52,911",so that all we see is them hitting him.
637,"00:42:52,953","00:42:56,581",You got Powell and Koon cracking him with billy clubs...
638,"00:42:56,623","00:42:58,875",and Briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull...
639,"00:42:58,917","00:43:00,293","so it looks severe, you know?"
640,"00:43:00,335","00:43:01,628","People are going, ""Oh, this poor guy."""
641,"00:43:01,670","00:43:03,672",This poor guy who attacked four cops...
642,"00:43:03,713","00:43:05,548",and those cops end up on the stand...
643,"00:43:05,590","00:43:10,178",defending themselves for using standard textbook procedures.
644,"00:43:10,220","00:43:12,305",I don't think the tapes showed that at all.
645,"00:43:12,347","00:43:15,433",You didn't think so? And you're an authority?
646,"00:43:15,475","00:43:17,769","Murray, what do you think?"
647,"00:43:19,479","00:43:23,400",I did think the police used their clubs rather excessively.
648,"00:43:23,441","00:43:25,110",Who are you to say what's excessive?
649,"00:43:25,151","00:43:26,820",I think it was totally appropriate.
650,"00:43:26,861","00:43:29,948",They're in a better position to make that call than you are.
651,"00:43:29,990","00:43:33,785","We, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority..."
652,"00:43:33,827","00:43:35,996","to make those calls, because we acknowledge..."
653,"00:43:36,037","00:43:38,248",that their job is difficult and dangerous.
654,"00:43:38,290","00:43:42,168",Very few people respect that and respect that authority.
655,"00:43:42,203","00:43:45,088",Look who's talking about respect-Mr. Junior KKK.
656,"00:43:45,130","00:43:46,298",What?
657,"00:43:48,091","00:43:50,302",You want to go to college? Learn to listen.
658,"00:43:50,343","00:43:53,638",I didn't say I respect the laws. I acknowledge a cop's authority.
659,"00:43:53,680","00:43:57,225",I don't respect laws that let Rodney King back on the street.
660,"00:43:57,267","00:44:00,562","Second, I am not a member of a low-rent..."
661,"00:44:00,603","00:44:04,733",disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK. Please.
662,"00:44:04,774","00:44:07,527",So take your head out of your ass.
663,"00:44:07,569","00:44:09,362",You've gotten off the point.
664,"00:44:09,404","00:44:11,990",I had a point. That wasn't even the point.
665,"00:44:12,032","00:44:13,950",Do you have one? What is your point?
666,"00:44:13,992","00:44:15,744","All right, think about this."
667,"00:44:15,785","00:44:18,288",If Danny was walking across the street that night...
668,"00:44:18,330","00:44:19,539",and Rodney King plowed into him-
669,"00:44:19,581","00:44:21,666",Can we drop this Rodney King thing?
670,"00:44:31,468","00:44:33,094",Who would like some dessert?
671,"00:44:34,929","00:44:36,014",We're having a discussion.
672,"00:44:36,056","00:44:38,391","We're having a nice discussion, right?"
673,"00:44:38,433","00:44:39,893",If Rodney King had been driving along...
674,"00:44:39,934","00:44:41,936",hopped up on PCP and had killed Danny...
675,"00:44:41,978","00:44:43,438",you'd be singing a different tune-
676,"00:44:43,480","00:44:46,441","I didn't see him hit anybody, and neither did you."
677,"00:44:46,483","00:44:49,110","He didn't happen to kill anybody, thank God."
678,"00:44:49,152","00:44:51,655","Keep it down, OK? Ally's sleeping."
679,"00:44:54,574","00:44:58,203",If that fucking monkey had run some kid over...
680,"00:44:58,244","00:45:01,456",everybody would have a very different opinion.
681,"00:45:01,498","00:45:04,709",They'd be focused on Rodney King and not on these officers.
682,"00:45:04,751","00:45:06,753","But instead, he just attacked a few cops..."
683,"00:45:06,795","00:45:08,546","so, suddenly, it's Hands Across America..."
684,"00:45:08,588","00:45:10,632",for this fucking total son of a bitch.
685,"00:45:10,674","00:45:12,057",It blows my mind.
686,"00:45:12,092","00:45:14,970",We're so hung up on this notion that we have some obligation...
687,"00:45:15,011","00:45:17,055",to help this struggling black man.
688,"00:45:17,097","00:45:19,391",Cut him some slack until he can overcome...
689,"00:45:19,432","00:45:20,732",these historical injustices.
690,"00:45:20,767","00:45:23,269",It's crap. This stuff just perpetuates it...
691,"00:45:23,311","00:45:24,813",all this liberal nonsense.
692,"00:45:24,854","00:45:26,314",Everyone's looking the other way...
693,"00:45:26,356","00:45:28,400",while our country rots from the inside out.
694,"00:45:28,441","00:45:32,028","I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves 130 years ago."
695,"00:45:32,070","00:45:34,114",How long does it take to get your act together?
696,"00:45:34,155","00:45:38,201","Jews have been persecuted for over 5,000 years."
697,"00:45:38,243","00:45:40,620",Are you saying it's wrong to feel sensitive...
698,"00:45:40,662","00:45:41,955",about anti-Semitism?
699,"00:45:41,997","00:45:43,331","Oh, forget that."
700,"00:45:43,373","00:45:46,418","I'm with you. I'm with you all the way, baby."
701,"00:45:46,459","00:45:48,253",I'm so sick of these liberal hypocrites.
702,"00:45:48,295","00:45:50,422",Here we go again. I love this part.
703,"00:45:50,463","00:45:51,506",This is great.
704,"00:45:51,548","00:45:53,466",Look how they scapegoated Chief Gates.
705,"00:45:53,508","00:45:56,136",Think they would've come down that hard on Willie Williams?
706,"00:45:56,177","00:45:59,556",No way. That videotape was a set-up to get rid of Gates.
707,"00:45:59,597","00:46:02,934",- Can I be excused? - No. Don't interrupt.
708,"00:46:02,976","00:46:05,270",Excuse me. I was talking. I listened to you.
709,"00:46:05,312","00:46:08,982",- Who do you think you are? - She's making a point.
710,"00:46:09,024","00:46:11,276","Davina, sit down."
711,"00:46:11,318","00:46:14,612",Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!
712,"00:46:14,654","00:46:17,949","- Derek, calm down. - Don't tell him to shut up!"
713,"00:46:17,991","00:46:20,869",Sit your ass down. No. Sit down. Shut your mouth.
714,"00:46:20,910","00:46:23,538",Move! Goddamn it! Move!
715,"00:46:23,580","00:46:25,832",Shut your mouth and give my girlfriend respect.
716,"00:46:25,874","00:46:28,293","Derek, what are you trying to prove?"
717,"00:46:28,335","00:46:29,961","Murray, stay out of it!"
718,"00:46:30,003","00:46:32,130",Where do you think you're going?
719,"00:46:32,172","00:46:35,008","Derek, let her go!"
720,"00:46:35,050","00:46:38,553","You need to learn some fucking manners, Davina!"
721,"00:46:38,595","00:46:40,972",Shut your fucking mouth!
722,"00:46:41,014","00:46:42,182",Stop!
723,"00:46:43,350","00:46:44,601",She can't breathe!
724,"00:46:46,519","00:46:47,646",Let her go!
725,"00:46:47,687","00:46:49,731",You going to apologize?
726,"00:46:51,691","00:46:54,903",You're a fucking asshole. I hate you!
727,"00:47:04,788","00:47:06,998",What are you doing? This is your family.
728,"00:47:07,040","00:47:09,000","Right. My family, so you know what?"
729,"00:47:09,042","00:47:12,379",I don't give two shits about you or what you think.
730,"00:47:12,420","00:47:14,214",You're not a part of it.
731,"00:47:14,255","00:47:16,675",- That has nothing to do with it. - It doesn't?
732,"00:47:16,716","00:47:18,510",You don't think I see what you're doing?
733,"00:47:18,551","00:47:20,136",You think I'll sit here and smile...
734,"00:47:20,178","00:47:22,681",while some fucking kike tries to fuck my mother?
735,"00:47:22,722","00:47:25,642",It's never going to happen. Fucking forget it.
736,"00:47:25,684","00:47:27,519",Not while I'm in this family.
737,"00:47:27,560","00:47:29,604",I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off...
738,"00:47:29,646","00:47:32,357",and stick it up your ass before I let that happen.
739,"00:47:32,399","00:47:34,901",Coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner...
740,"00:47:34,943","00:47:38,196","with your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit."
741,"00:47:41,741","00:47:44,703",Fuck you. Fuck you.
742,"00:47:44,744","00:47:46,538","Yeah, walk out."
743,"00:47:46,579","00:47:49,082",Asshole. Fucking cabala-reading motherfucker.
744,"00:47:49,124","00:47:50,667",Get out of my house.
745,"00:47:55,672","00:47:57,882",You see this? That means not welcome.
746,"00:48:10,520","00:48:11,646",What did I do?
747,"00:48:11,688","00:48:13,690",You disgust me.
748,"00:48:13,732","00:48:16,401","Bring him to our table, primping your hair and your dress."
749,"00:48:16,443","00:48:18,611",What did I do?
750,"00:48:18,653","00:48:20,614",You're all tarted up.
751,"00:48:20,655","00:48:22,365",How could you bring him to my father's table?
752,"00:48:22,407","00:48:25,577",How could you go from Dad to that? Aren't you ashamed?
753,"00:48:25,619","00:48:29,039",I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!
754,"00:48:32,459","00:48:35,378",Go run to your fucking kike! Run to him!
755,"00:48:41,468","00:48:44,429","It's OK. I'm proud of you, baby."
756,"00:48:51,144","00:48:54,731","I'm so sorry, Doris. I really am."
757,"00:49:02,989","00:49:04,115",He's gone.
758,"00:49:04,157","00:49:08,954",He's just a boy without a father.
759,"00:49:08,995","00:49:12,707","Doris, you don't know the world your children are living in."
760,"00:49:22,592","00:49:24,219",Good-bye.
761,"00:50:09,681","00:50:11,266","Hey, you all right?"
762,"00:50:13,935","00:50:16,896","- Take this, you fucking dick! - No. Come here."
763,"00:50:16,938","00:50:18,523",- Fuck you! - Calm down.
764,"00:50:18,565","00:50:19,899",- Let go of me! - Calm down.
765,"00:50:19,941","00:50:21,192","Let me go, God damn it!"
766,"00:50:21,234","00:50:23,445",- Fuck you! - I'm sorry.
767,"00:50:25,030","00:50:27,372",I would never hurt you. You know that.
768,"00:50:27,407","00:50:31,036",I screwed up. I lost control. It's not you.
769,"00:50:31,077","00:50:34,247",I'm sorry. I'd never hurt you guys.
770,"00:50:34,289","00:50:36,958",You know that. I'd do anything for you.
771,"00:50:37,000","00:50:38,335",I don't believe you.
772,"00:50:38,376","00:50:40,712","I trust you, Derek."
773,"00:50:51,931","00:50:55,143",What are you doing out of bed? Want a plane ride?
774,"00:50:55,185","00:50:58,104",- Yeah. - Going for takeoff.
775,"00:51:04,277","00:51:05,695","Oh, no, don't crash."
776,"00:51:07,030","00:51:10,742",Better go to Mom. She's a crazy flier.
777,"00:51:10,784","00:51:13,787","Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah."
778,"00:51:22,420","00:51:25,715",- You don't feel too hot. - No. It's my chest.
779,"00:51:25,757","00:51:28,259",- What are you up to? - I'm just thinking.
780,"00:51:28,301","00:51:30,991",Yeah? There's a lot of that going around.
781,"00:51:31,026","00:51:33,682",I don't even know how we got here sometimes.
782,"00:51:33,723","00:51:36,476","I feel like I let you down, only I didn't know when it happened."
783,"00:51:36,518","00:51:38,228","Mom, it's OK."
784,"00:51:42,190","00:51:44,150",It's cold in here. No wonder you're sick.
785,"00:51:44,192","00:51:46,861",You don't get sick from cold. You get sick from germs.
786,"00:51:46,903","00:51:49,656",No. You get sick from smoking.
787,"00:51:50,824","00:51:54,369",You ought to quit. It's not good for you.
788,"00:52:00,125","00:52:02,127",What are you looking at me like that for?
789,"00:52:02,168","00:52:04,879",When are you going to let that beautiful hair grow back?
790,"00:52:06,673","00:52:08,758",The day you quit smoking.
791,"00:52:11,803","00:52:13,346",Deal.
792,"00:52:13,388","00:52:18,143",I'd better get Ally to bed. You say good night to Mom?
793,"00:52:18,184","00:52:20,312",Then you have to go to bed. Come on.
794,"00:52:20,353","00:52:22,856","- Good night, Mama. - Good night, baby."
795,"00:52:57,223","00:53:00,769",I go back to that night again and again in my mind.
796,"00:53:00,810","00:53:03,104",I try to stop it from happening.
797,"00:53:03,146","00:53:05,023",I want you out of this house.
798,"00:53:05,065","00:53:07,025",That's fine. I'll be gone in the morning.
799,"00:53:08,401","00:53:09,694",He can move in with me.
800,"00:53:11,071","00:53:13,323","In my mind, I imagine what would've happened..."
801,"00:53:13,365","00:53:16,743",if I hadn't gone to that room and told him.
802,"00:53:18,078","00:53:19,287",Get down!
803,"00:53:20,622","00:53:21,998","No, Derek!"
804,"00:53:23,583","00:53:26,044","Help, Mommy!"
805,"00:53:40,016","00:53:43,311","Nigger, you just fucked with the wrong bull. Come here!"
806,"00:53:43,353","00:53:44,437",Damn!
807,"00:53:44,479","00:53:47,941",Should've learned your place on the fucking basketball court...
808,"00:53:47,976","00:53:49,693",but you fucking monkeys never get the message!
809,"00:53:51,319","00:53:53,697","My father gave me that truck, you motherfucker!"
810,"00:53:53,738","00:53:57,409",You ever shoot at firemen? You shoot at my family?
811,"00:53:57,450","00:53:59,828","I'm going to teach you a real lesson now, motherfucker."
812,"00:53:59,869","00:54:02,080",Put your fucking mouth on the curb.
813,"00:54:02,122","00:54:03,088","Hold on, man."
814,"00:54:03,123","00:54:06,084",Put it on the curb right now!
815,"00:54:09,504","00:54:10,463",That's it.
816,"00:54:10,505","00:54:12,257","Derek, no!"
817,"00:54:16,720","00:54:18,305",Now say good night.
818,"00:54:31,151","00:54:32,110",Fucker.
819,"00:54:38,283","00:54:41,745",Drop your weapon! Put your weapon on the ground!
820,"00:54:41,828","00:54:43,788",Put your hands up!
821,"00:54:43,830","00:54:47,292",I said get your hands up! Now turn around!
822,"00:54:56,426","00:54:58,970",Put your hands behind your head!
823,"00:55:02,682","00:55:04,684",Get down on your knees right now!
824,"00:56:02,409","00:56:06,246",It's all right.
825,"00:56:08,206","00:56:09,332",Let's go.
826,"00:56:11,293","00:56:14,129",- Come on. - No.
827,"00:56:21,594","00:56:23,179",She ain't gonna open the door?
828,"00:56:23,221","00:56:25,807",Someone right fucking there looking at us. Hello?
829,"00:56:25,849","00:56:27,475","Danny, it's for you."
830,"00:56:28,476","00:56:30,312",Be right there.
831,"00:56:43,491","00:56:46,494","Open the door, Danny. It's fucking freezing!"
832,"00:56:46,536","00:56:48,538","Danny, I'm gonna be sick!"
833,"00:56:48,580","00:56:51,583","Come on, Danny!"
834,"00:57:22,155","00:57:23,531",I'm gonna go get some beers.
835,"00:57:36,670","00:57:38,797","Hey, what a party, fatso?"
836,"00:57:38,838","00:57:42,634","I'm not fat, asshole! I'm husky!"
837,"00:57:42,676","00:57:44,678","What the fuck's up, Seth?"
838,"00:57:44,719","00:57:46,972","Drink up, Danny, before your brother sees you."
839,"00:57:47,013","00:57:48,223","Holy fuck, he's here!"
840,"00:57:48,264","00:57:51,518","Yeah, he's fucking here. Go pay your respects."
841,"00:57:51,559","00:57:52,560","Fuck you, Seth!"
842,"00:57:54,938","00:57:57,649","Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny."
843,"00:57:57,691","00:57:59,484",- Father Vinyard? - How's it going?
844,"00:57:59,526","00:58:02,320","I'm Jason, this is Chris. We're friends with your brother."
845,"00:58:02,362","00:58:05,073","You are a fucking god, man!"
846,"00:58:23,216","00:58:25,135",I thought you turned that paper in.
847,"00:58:25,176","00:58:27,971",I did. Now fucking Murray turned me in...
848,"00:58:28,013","00:58:31,224",so Sweeney's making me write another one.
849,"00:58:32,809","00:58:36,104",Good old Sweeney. He never stops trying.
850,"00:58:36,146","00:58:39,107","He's one of those ""proud to be nigger"" people."
851,"00:58:39,149","00:58:40,532",I hate those guys.
852,"00:58:40,567","00:58:43,778","Wait a minute, Danny. He's not proud."
853,"00:58:43,820","00:58:49,284","No. He's a manipulative, self-righteous Uncle Tom."
854,"00:58:49,326","00:58:52,537",He's making you feel guilty about writing on Adolf Hitler.
855,"00:58:52,579","00:58:57,709","Some nigger, some spic writes about Martin Luther King..."
856,"00:58:57,751","00:59:02,255",or fucking Cesar commie Chavez gets a pat on the head.
857,"00:59:02,297","00:59:04,382",Yeah.
858,"00:59:04,424","00:59:08,261","You can see the hypocrisy in that, can't you?"
859,"00:59:08,303","00:59:09,304",Definitely.
860,"00:59:13,767","00:59:15,310","Come on, let's go."
861,"00:59:15,352","00:59:18,188",No. Listen. Wait.
862,"00:59:18,229","00:59:20,190","I want to see you, OK?"
863,"00:59:20,231","00:59:23,234","I do, but I gotta take care of something tonight."
864,"00:59:25,153","00:59:27,781",- OK. - You understand?
865,"00:59:27,822","00:59:31,159","Yeah. I'm here. When you're ready, I'm here."
866,"00:59:34,955","00:59:37,540",- Would you do something with me? - Anything.
867,"00:59:37,582","00:59:39,542",Leave with me.
868,"00:59:39,626","00:59:42,128",Leave where?
869,"00:59:42,170","00:59:46,091",Leave here. Leave all this. Just come with me.
870,"00:59:46,132","00:59:48,093",Why would you want to leave?
871,"00:59:48,134","00:59:49,761",They worship you. You're like a god to them.
872,"00:59:49,803","00:59:53,264","If we had it good before, wait till you see what it's like now."
873,"00:59:53,306","00:59:56,935",I don't want all that. I don't want my family involved.
874,"00:59:56,977","00:59:59,521","Everything I've done here fucked it all up, understand?"
875,"00:59:59,562","01:00:01,606",You think what you did was wrong?
876,"01:00:01,648","01:00:04,484","Oh, baby. Oh, come on."
877,"01:00:04,526","01:00:07,070",Those niggers got exactly what they deserved...
878,"01:00:07,112","01:00:09,447",and we all know that.
879,"01:00:09,489","01:00:12,617","I understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you."
880,"01:00:12,659","01:00:15,120",No one can touch you. There's a small army out there.
881,"01:00:15,161","01:00:17,747",We're not gonna let a bunch of spooks kick us out.
882,"01:00:17,789","01:00:20,083",You're not listening to me. I'm not scared.
883,"01:00:20,125","01:00:22,335",I don't want it anymore.
884,"01:00:22,377","01:00:26,006",I'm done with it. I'm through with this.
885,"01:00:26,047","01:00:30,927","It's bullshit, Stacey."
886,"01:00:30,969","01:00:34,055","You don't need this, Stacey. Come on, trust me."
887,"01:00:34,097","01:00:37,851","If you want to be with me, just trust me. Come with me."
888,"01:00:37,892","01:00:39,144",Come on.
889,"01:00:39,185","01:00:42,647",You're nuts. You are nuts. No way.
890,"01:00:42,689","01:00:45,734",I don't think you realize what's been going on here.
891,"01:00:45,775","01:00:49,571","We are 10 times what we were, and we are bloody organized."
892,"01:00:49,613","01:00:52,157",It is like nothing you have ever seen.
893,"01:00:52,198","01:00:54,034",This was a mistake. Forget it.
894,"01:00:54,075","01:00:56,494",Wait a second. What was a mistake?
895,"01:00:56,536","01:00:58,747","Stacey, just say good-bye."
896,"01:00:58,788","01:01:01,708",This isn't you. I know you.
897,"01:01:01,750","01:01:03,668","You don't know anything about me, Stacey."
898,"01:01:11,384","01:01:13,852",- Are you Danny's brother? - Yeah.
899,"01:01:13,887","01:01:16,931",Will you tell him Lizzy's looking for him?
900,"01:01:16,973","01:01:18,933",Thank you.
901,"01:01:20,685","01:01:24,522","We'll let the niggers, kikes, and spics grab for the pie."
902,"01:01:24,564","01:01:26,733",Can't blame 'em.
903,"01:01:26,775","01:01:29,277","Course, they're gonna have to fight to get it."
904,"01:01:31,071","01:01:33,865",And if we scare the fuck out of people...
905,"01:01:33,907","01:01:37,911","and a few people get killed in the process, so be it."
906,"01:01:37,953","01:01:40,622","Gonna put that in your paper, Danny?"
907,"01:01:40,664","01:01:43,375","Hey, man."
908,"01:01:43,416","01:01:47,754","Well, look who's here. The return of the soldier."
909,"01:01:47,796","01:01:49,798","What are you doing here, Danny?"
910,"01:01:49,839","01:01:52,926","Come on, man. I had to check it out."
911,"01:01:52,968","01:01:54,219",You knew I was gonna come.
912,"01:01:54,260","01:01:58,223","Let the kid alone, Derek. He knows when to go to bed."
913,"01:02:00,225","01:02:01,393",Go wait outside.
914,"01:02:01,434","01:02:03,728","Come on, Der. I'm not doing anything."
915,"01:02:03,770","01:02:07,190",This little blonde girl keeps asking for you.
916,"01:02:07,273","01:02:09,025",She's dying. Come on.
917,"01:02:09,067","01:02:11,486",- I gotta check out. - Go easy on her.
918,"01:02:11,528","01:02:13,530",All right.
919,"01:02:17,367","01:02:18,994",Wait for me right outside.
920,"01:02:23,832","01:02:26,001",Take it easy.
921,"01:02:26,042","01:02:28,461",Chill out.
922,"01:02:28,503","01:02:30,922",You're on safe ground.
923,"01:02:30,964","01:02:33,675",You don't have to watch your ass around here.
924,"01:02:35,135","01:02:37,095",Come on. Sit down. Relax.
925,"01:02:39,139","01:02:41,933",I'm sorry. The party was a little quick...
926,"01:02:41,975","01:02:45,228","but we're just so damn glad you're back, Derek."
927,"01:02:45,270","01:02:47,314",It's only natural you should feel a little funny.
928,"01:02:47,355","01:02:48,815","I don't feel funny, Cam."
929,"01:02:48,857","01:02:51,610",You made the fat kid a little nervous.
930,"01:02:51,651","01:02:53,653",He thinks the joint messed with your mind.
931,"01:02:53,688","01:02:55,155",It did.
932,"01:03:02,245","01:03:11,046","Glory, glory, hallelujah..."
933,"01:03:11,087","01:03:14,424",The white man marches on!
934,"01:03:14,466","01:03:17,636",Things have changed since you've been gone.
935,"01:03:17,677","01:03:19,846",You talk about organization?
936,"01:03:19,888","01:03:22,807",Wait'll you see what we've done with the internet.
937,"01:03:22,849","01:03:24,809",We've got every gang from Seattle to San Diego...
938,"01:03:24,851","01:03:26,436",working together now.
939,"01:03:26,478","01:03:28,938",Not competing anymore. They're consolidated.
940,"01:03:29,022","01:03:31,399",Only thing we lack is a little overall leadership.
941,"01:03:31,441","01:03:34,611",That's where you come in.
942,"01:03:34,653","01:03:37,697",Those people out there got a lot of respect for you.
943,"01:03:37,739","01:03:39,991","When you're ready, come talk to me about it."
944,"01:03:40,033","01:03:43,787","You can forget about that. I'm done with it, Cam."
945,"01:03:43,828","01:03:47,457","Yeah, well, I know you grew out of..."
946,"01:03:47,499","01:03:51,002","that shaved head bullshit a long time ago, thank God."
947,"01:03:51,044","01:03:52,796",I like your hair the way it is now.
948,"01:03:52,837","01:03:55,840","See, that's what I mean. We're thinking bigger now."

953,"01:04:03,598","01:04:06,726",I understand how you feel. You've just done hard time.
954,"01:04:06,768","01:04:08,895",Don't you fucking talk to me about hard time.
955,"01:04:08,937","01:04:11,106",- You don't know anything. - I've done mine.
956,"01:04:11,147","01:04:13,531",You didn't do shit. I found out about you.
957,"01:04:13,566","01:04:15,568","You did two months, then rolled over on two kids..."

1061,"01:10:05,627","01:10:08,755",All the wrong people knew who I was anyway...
1062,"01:10:08,797","01:10:11,925",so I figured I'd put up a flag and hope a friend sees it.
1063,"01:11:14,404","01:11:17,324",That's the cat I'm talking about right there.
1064,"01:11:36,509","01:11:38,511",Boss.
1065,"01:11:38,553","01:11:40,138",Have a seat.

1068,"01:11:54,819","01:11:57,155",'Cause I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.
1069,"01:11:57,197","01:12:01,117",You know why? 'Cause I control the underwear.

1071,"01:12:11,962","01:12:13,922","And I hope you work out, all right?"
1072,"01:12:13,964","01:12:16,967",'Cause the last guy they sent me didn't wear no drawers...

1075,"01:12:21,429","01:12:23,848","We got two sizes-medium and large, all right?"
1076,"01:12:23,890","01:12:26,351",All you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums...

1078,"01:12:28,061","01:12:30,021",I know it's a boring job...
1079,"01:12:30,063","01:12:32,232",but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
1080,"01:12:32,274","01:12:36,194",I spent two years in the kitchen scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.
1081,"01:12:36,236","01:12:39,114","That you don't wanna do, all right?"
1082,"01:12:39,155","01:12:41,157",You should be happy as shit you landed this job.

1087,"01:13:07,225","01:13:09,519","OK, I know your kind, right?"
1088,"01:13:09,561","01:13:11,896",Bad-ass peckerwood with an attitude.

1091,"01:13:25,493","01:13:29,164",I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.
1092,"01:13:29,205","01:13:31,916",Then everything started getting complicated.
1093,"01:13:58,944","01:14:00,570",What the fuck is that?
1094,"01:14:02,030","01:14:03,281",What's that all about?
1095,"01:14:03,323","01:14:06,993","That's just politics, man. Favors, you know?"
1096,"01:14:08,578","01:14:11,498",He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

1100,"01:14:19,714","01:14:21,841",No.
1101,"01:14:21,883","01:14:23,808","That's bullshit, man."
1102,"01:14:23,843","01:14:25,512",Somebody should say something to him.
1103,"01:14:25,553","01:14:27,180",What the fuck is he thinking?
1104,"01:14:27,222","01:14:30,100",Mitch is the only reason you're not a corpse right now.
1105,"01:14:30,141","01:14:32,560",You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.
1106,"01:14:32,602","01:14:34,813",I can take care of myself.
1107,"01:14:34,854","01:14:38,775","He shouldn't be doing that. I'm getting sick of it, man."
1108,"01:14:38,817","01:14:41,528",There's a lot of hard talk here and no follow-through.
1109,"01:14:44,239","01:14:48,118",I think you better chill out on the preaching bullshit.
1110,"01:14:48,159","01:14:50,578",We're getting a little tired of that shit around here.

1113,"01:15:25,488","01:15:27,657",I was in the neighborhood.
1114,"01:15:27,699","01:15:30,452","Look, I told you I don't want you all coming up here."
1115,"01:15:30,493","01:15:33,663","I don't care what you told me, OK?"
1116,"01:15:33,705","01:15:34,998",I need to talk to you now.
1117,"01:15:55,602","01:15:57,103","So, how is everyone?"
1118,"01:15:57,145","01:16:02,108",Davina's great. She's getting straight As almost.
1119,"01:16:02,143","01:16:07,072","And Ally's walking, starting to talk a little."
1120,"01:16:12,118","01:16:13,244",How's Danny?
1121,"01:16:19,042","01:16:21,836",He holds you up so high.
1122,"01:16:21,878","01:16:25,173",He thinks you're the greatest.
1123,"01:16:25,215","01:16:28,343",He's always bragging about you to Cameron...
1124,"01:16:28,385","01:16:30,303",and all his new friends.
1125,"01:16:33,890","01:16:35,684",He's starting to remind me of you.
1126,"01:16:35,725","01:16:38,687","Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?"
1127,"01:16:38,728","01:16:42,774","I'm sure he's fine. He's 16 years old, Doris."
1128,"01:16:42,816","01:16:44,567",He's not gonna be a little angel forever.
1129,"01:16:44,609","01:16:47,070",You think because I watched my firstborn...
1130,"01:16:47,112","01:16:49,739",fuck up his entire life that I can sit here...
1131,"01:16:49,781","01:16:53,201",and see my baby follow him down the same toilet?
1132,"01:16:53,243","01:16:54,953",I can't fix all this shit from up here.

1137,"01:17:06,172","01:17:08,008",You think I'm not in here with you?
1138,"01:17:20,645","01:17:22,105","Fuck, man."
1139,"01:17:24,983","01:17:27,277",Every day I watch you go through these sheets...
1140,"01:17:27,319","01:17:29,154",like you gonna get to the end of them.

1149,"01:17:55,513","01:17:57,557","I know, I'm just a dumb, stupid nigger, right?"
1150,"01:17:57,599","01:17:59,309",What do I know?
1151,"01:18:01,353","01:18:04,898","I know I ain't the one getting mad at them sheets, though."
1152,"01:18:04,940","01:18:07,943","As a matter of fact, the only sheets I get mad at..."
1153,"01:18:07,984","01:18:09,945",I'll tell you.
1154,"01:18:11,446","01:18:14,032","All right, boy, this is what we gonna do."
1155,"01:18:14,074","01:18:15,909",We gonna hate some niggers. That's what we'll do today.
1156,"01:18:15,951","01:18:17,702",We gonna hate some goddamn niggers.
1157,"01:18:17,744","01:18:19,245",That's all we gonna do is hate some niggers all day.
1158,"01:18:19,287","01:18:22,457","Don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them."
1159,"01:18:22,499","01:18:24,417",My cousin Derek is in the pen right now...
1160,"01:18:24,459","01:18:28,797","working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy."

1165,"01:19:01,496","01:19:04,249","""It's better than the pig I just tried to fuck."""
1166,"01:19:07,168","01:19:09,546",He never lets me finish the joke.

1168,"01:19:13,091","01:19:16,052","Whatever. She's laying on her back, her legs are open..."
1169,"01:19:18,305","01:19:22,267",What's up? How you doing? There you go.
1170,"01:19:33,361","01:19:36,197",He was taking it from the Mexicans...
1171,"01:19:36,239","01:19:38,325",and dealing it out to his own people.
1172,"01:19:38,366","01:19:41,411",He didn't believe in shit. None of them did.
1173,"01:20:07,103","01:20:10,315","What? Come on, man."
1174,"01:20:10,357","01:20:14,569",Don't look at me like that. You know what that smells like.
1175,"01:20:14,611","01:20:16,988",Don't tell me this smell don't remind you of a woman.
1176,"01:20:19,366","01:20:20,742","God, I miss that smell, man."
1177,"01:20:21,868","01:20:25,288",The job I had on the outside wasn't much better than this...
1178,"01:20:25,372","01:20:27,499",but at least I got to go home every night...
1179,"01:20:27,540","01:20:30,001","and lie down next to that sweet smell, man."
1180,"01:20:32,045","01:20:35,507","God, I miss that. You got a woman?"
1181,"01:20:36,675","01:20:38,510","Yeah, you got a woman, man."

1185,"01:20:46,059","01:20:48,019","don't let her leave here in a fight, man."
1186,"01:20:48,061","01:20:50,021",Don't let her walk out with a bad attitude...
1187,"01:20:50,063","01:20:52,691","'cause if you do, you spend the next week..."
1188,"01:20:52,732","01:20:55,527",wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else...
1189,"01:20:55,568","01:20:57,028",you know what I'm saying?
1190,"01:20:57,070","01:20:59,531","So when she come to see you, it's nothing but sweet talk."
1191,"01:20:59,572","01:21:02,242","Send her away floating, all right?"
1192,"01:21:02,284","01:21:05,537",'Cause it's not like the real world where you can fight...
1193,"01:21:05,578","01:21:08,707",'cause you can make up and have that make-up sex.

1196,"01:21:12,419","01:21:15,755",You lay on your back and let her take out that aggression on you.
1197,"01:21:15,797","01:21:17,424","All guys know that, man. That's that good sex."
1198,"01:21:17,465","01:21:20,302","That's that pow, pow, pow."
1199,"01:21:20,343","01:21:23,305","Let her get on top, and she'll punish you first."
1200,"01:21:23,346","01:21:24,973","""You been a bad boy, huh?"
1201,"01:21:25,015","01:21:27,851","""You been a bad boy, and I'm gonna punish you."

1212,"01:22:11,853","01:22:13,939",How do you figure the Lakers to ever be a bigger dynasty...
1213,"01:22:13,980","01:22:15,774",than the Celtics?
1214,"01:22:15,815","01:22:18,318","The Lakers are a flare-up, a fluke."
1215,"01:22:18,353","01:22:19,527",Are you crazy?
1216,"01:22:19,569","01:22:21,613",One good coach for four years. The Celtics are a dynasty!
1217,"01:22:21,655","01:22:24,282","Come on, man. The Celtics, right?"
1218,"01:22:24,324","01:22:26,534",The ugliest team in the history of sports.
1219,"01:22:26,576","01:22:28,703","A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man."
1220,"01:22:28,745","01:22:30,956",Look at Kevin McHale.
1221,"01:22:30,997","01:22:33,750",James Worthy. That guy has a head like a melon.
1222,"01:22:33,792","01:22:35,126",He had ladies.
1223,"01:22:35,168","01:22:37,837",I can't even talk to you. I don't know what you're saying.
1224,"01:22:37,879","01:22:40,799",You are tweaking. Boston Celtics.
1225,"01:22:40,840","01:22:42,968",- How many is that? - That's enough.
1226,"01:22:43,009","01:22:44,177",Enough? All right.
1227,"01:22:48,014","01:22:49,349",You got that?
1228,"01:22:54,020","01:22:57,023","- I lost count, man. - Doesn't matter, man."
1229,"01:22:57,058","01:22:59,526",Who's counting anyway?
1230,"01:23:06,825","01:23:08,994","All right, so I wanna know something."
1231,"01:23:09,995","01:23:11,997",What the fuck landed you in here?
1232,"01:23:12,038","01:23:14,249","You didn't kill anybody, too skinny for a gangbanger."
1233,"01:23:14,291","01:23:16,960",Ain't that a bitch? Don't judge a book by its cover.
1234,"01:23:17,002","01:23:18,420",I can throw these things.
1235,"01:23:18,461","01:23:21,339",Whatever. Come on. What did you do?
1236,"01:23:21,381","01:23:23,967",None of your business. It's embarrassing.
1237,"01:23:24,009","01:23:25,844",It's none of your goddamn business.
1238,"01:23:27,012","01:23:29,973",Come on. Everybody in here is embarrassed.
1239,"01:23:30,015","01:23:32,475",Nobody in here got away with anything.
1240,"01:23:33,518","01:23:34,978",What'd you do?
1241,"01:23:36,855","01:23:39,482","Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?"
1242,"01:23:39,524","01:23:42,193",So you stole a TV. What's embarrassing about that?
1243,"01:23:42,235","01:23:45,989",I stole a TV from a store next to a doughnut shop.
1244,"01:23:46,031","01:23:48,992","I ran out, the owner's right behind me yelling."
1245,"01:23:49,034","01:23:50,910",Bam! I run into three cops.
1246,"01:23:50,952","01:23:54,414",I told you it was embarrassing. You're laughing.
1247,"01:23:54,456","01:23:57,000","Wait a sec, wait a sec."
1248,"01:23:57,042","01:23:58,877",That don't make sense.
1249,"01:24:00,128","01:24:03,965","Nah, you didn't get six years for stealing a TV. Come on."
1250,"01:24:04,007","01:24:07,427","I come out, the police officer grabs my arm..."
1251,"01:24:07,469","01:24:09,394",the TV falls on his foot and breaks it.
1252,"01:24:09,429","01:24:14,225",They said I threw the TV at him. Assault. Six years.
1253,"01:24:14,267","01:24:18,396",Come on. Tell the truth. You chucked it at him.
1254,"01:24:18,438","01:24:21,399","Like I said, I came out of the store..."
1255,"01:24:21,441","01:24:25,070","he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot."
1256,"01:24:29,866","01:24:31,117",Come on now.
1257,"01:24:31,159","01:24:33,912","What you got for me, huh?"
1258,"01:24:34,955","01:24:36,289","There you go, baby!"
1259,"01:24:36,331","01:24:38,708",Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
1260,"01:25:17,247","01:25:18,498",Fuck you!
1261,"01:25:18,540","01:25:20,417",Give me a towel. Hold him.
1262,"01:25:27,674","01:25:29,509","You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?"
1263,"01:25:29,551","01:25:32,137",- Fuck you! - We gonna treat you like one.
1264,"01:25:32,178","01:25:35,307",- No. - Come on.
1265,"01:25:37,309","01:25:38,977","Come on, give it to him!"
1266,"01:25:50,196","01:25:51,740",Fuck you!
1267,"01:25:55,702","01:25:58,163",That was real sweet.
1268,"01:25:58,204","01:25:59,372",Fuck you!
1269,"01:26:31,947","01:26:32,989",How is he?
1270,"01:26:34,157","01:26:36,493","Well, he took six stitches."
1271,"01:27:17,951","01:27:20,919","Man, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?"
1272,"01:27:20,954","01:27:24,082","I came to talk about Danny, but we don't have to do that now."
1273,"01:27:24,124","01:27:26,126",I brought you some books.
1274,"01:27:28,461","01:27:31,756","What about him, you know? Don't keep me in suspense."
1275,"01:27:31,798","01:27:33,800",He's headed right where you are.
1276,"01:27:34,801","01:27:38,430",You know what? My mother already laid this trip on me.
1277,"01:27:38,471","01:27:41,182",Danny's not my responsibility.
1278,"01:27:41,224","01:27:42,934",What do you expect me to do with that?
1279,"01:27:42,976","01:27:45,770",It doesn't help me. Am I supposed to feel guilty?
1280,"01:27:45,812","01:27:47,230",I don't want you to do anything.
1281,"01:27:47,814","01:27:49,941",I need to know the truth about how you feel.
1282,"01:27:49,983","01:27:51,985",You think I want him in here?
1283,"01:27:52,020","01:27:54,446",I mean... I don't know.
1284,"01:27:54,487","01:27:55,947",I don't know what I feel. I'm all...
1285,"01:27:58,199","01:28:00,285",I feel a little inside out.
1286,"01:28:00,327","01:28:02,294","I'm, you know-I don't know."
1287,"01:28:02,329","01:28:06,249",There's some things that... that don't fit.
1288,"01:28:06,291","01:28:08,501","Well, that happens."
1289,"01:28:09,502","01:28:12,172",You are too damn smart to be floating around here...
1290,"01:28:12,213","01:28:14,633",pretending you don't see all the holes in this bullshit.
1291,"01:28:14,674","01:28:16,593","Hey, listen. I said I was confused."
1292,"01:28:16,635","01:28:18,803",I didn't say I didn't believe in it.
1293,"01:28:18,845","01:28:20,931",All right. That's why you have to stay open.
1294,"01:28:20,972","01:28:23,433","Right now, your anger is consuming you here."
1295,"01:28:23,475","01:28:26,645",Your anger is shutting down the brain God gave you.
1296,"01:28:26,686","01:28:28,688","God. You know, man? You've been talking about..."
1297,"01:28:28,730","01:28:30,565",what's going on with me since I was in high school.
1298,"01:28:30,607","01:28:33,443",How the fuck do you know what's going on inside me?
1299,"01:28:33,485","01:28:37,447","No, I know about me. I know about this place."
1300,"01:28:37,489","01:28:39,449",I know about the place you are in.
1301,"01:28:39,491","01:28:42,243",What do you know about the place I'm in?
1302,"01:28:42,285","01:28:44,454",There was a moment...
1303,"01:28:44,496","01:28:47,457",when I used to blame everything and everyone...
1304,"01:28:47,499","01:28:49,960",for all the pain and suffering...
1305,"01:28:50,001","01:28:52,128",and vile things that happened to me...
1306,"01:28:52,170","01:28:54,714",that I saw happen to my people.
1307,"01:28:54,756","01:28:56,549",Used to blame everybody.
1308,"01:28:56,591","01:29:00,136","Blamed white people, blamed society, blamed God."
1309,"01:29:00,178","01:29:03,348",I didn't get no answers 'cause I asked the wrong questions.
1310,"01:29:03,390","01:29:05,892",You have to ask the right question.
1311,"01:29:05,934","01:29:07,185",Like what?
1312,"01:29:09,604","01:29:12,524",Has anything you've done made your life better?
1313,"01:29:32,961","01:29:34,462","You gotta help me, man."
1314,"01:29:37,257","01:29:38,967",Just help me.
1315,"01:29:40,802","01:29:42,846","Get me out of here, you know?"
1316,"01:29:45,640","01:29:48,310",I'm up in four months for review.
1317,"01:29:49,978","01:29:51,980",Put in a word for me.
1318,"01:29:52,022","01:29:54,566","I already have. So you're out there, and then what?"
1319,"01:29:54,608","01:29:57,444",I don't want to fuck up my family anymore.
1320,"01:29:57,485","01:29:59,738",I'll go as far away as I can get.
1321,"01:29:59,779","01:30:01,573",That's not good enough.
1322,"01:30:01,615","01:30:05,035","You want my help, you gotta do better than that."
1323,"01:30:05,076","01:30:07,537",My help is not unconditional.
1324,"01:30:07,621","01:30:10,832",Running just ain't good enough.
1325,"01:30:43,531","01:30:46,826",Fuck him. Fuck him.
1326,"01:30:46,868","01:30:48,578",Fuck him. Let the niggers have him.
1327,"01:30:50,038","01:30:51,373","What's up, D?"
1328,"01:30:51,414","01:30:54,626",What's all that bullshit you pulled in the mess hall?
1329,"01:30:55,835","01:30:58,713",You out of your fucking mind? Are you fucking crazy?
1330,"01:30:58,755","01:31:01,049","D, look at me, man!"
1331,"01:31:01,091","01:31:03,677",You can't make it in here on your own.
1332,"01:31:03,718","01:31:05,804",I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
1333,"01:31:05,845","01:31:07,973","There was six of them, and they jumped me."
1334,"01:31:08,014","01:31:10,392",That won't happen again. I hope they fucking try.
1335,"01:31:10,433","01:31:12,936","Man, I'm not talking about your peckerwood friends!"
1336,"01:31:13,019","01:31:15,313",They're protecting your stupid ass!
1337,"01:31:15,355","01:31:19,150",You dissed them in public! Now you're on your fucking own!
1338,"01:31:19,192","01:31:21,987","Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers, all right?"
1339,"01:31:22,028","01:31:25,156","They'll fuck you, then smoke your motherfucking ass!"
1340,"01:31:25,198","01:31:27,826",Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
1341,"01:31:27,867","01:31:29,995",You think I haven't thought about that?
1342,"01:31:30,036","01:31:33,498","If they come for me, they come. There ain't nothing I can do."
1343,"01:31:34,791","01:31:36,668","What can I do, man?"
1344,"01:31:41,548","01:31:44,009",So I was right back where I started.
1345,"01:31:44,050","01:31:46,094",Every day I was sure it was my day.
1346,"01:31:47,304","01:31:50,265",Every time I stepped out of my cell...
1347,"01:31:50,307","01:31:53,018",every time I got in that shower...
1348,"01:31:56,104","01:31:58,023",I figured it was only a matter of time...
1349,"01:31:58,064","01:32:00,025",before they made a move.
1350,"01:32:01,234","01:32:03,361",I just hoped it'd be quick.
1351,"01:32:35,018","01:32:37,354",But it never came.
1352,"01:32:39,064","01:32:40,315",I couldn't figure it out.
1353,"01:32:40,357","01:32:42,317",I knew some of them were itching for it.
1354,"01:32:42,359","01:32:44,361","After awhile, I just put my head down..."
1355,"01:32:44,444","01:32:46,237",and read the stuff that Sweeney sent me...
1356,"01:32:46,279","01:32:48,031",and I kept to myself.
1357,"01:32:50,116","01:32:53,745","Last six months in that place, I was like a ghost."
1358,"01:33:07,467","01:33:10,011","What's up, man? You getting out?"
1359,"01:33:12,138","01:33:13,932","Come on, man. What the fuck you waiting on?"
1360,"01:33:13,974","01:33:16,101","Get the fuck on outta here, man."
1361,"01:33:17,978","01:33:20,021","Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling."
1362,"01:33:20,063","01:33:21,940","Oh, yeah? What's that?"
1363,"01:33:23,316","01:33:25,068",I'm thinking maybe the only reason...
1364,"01:33:25,110","01:33:26,945",I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.
1365,"01:33:28,488","01:33:29,948","Come on, man! Get the fuck outta here!"
1366,"01:33:29,990","01:33:31,992",You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line...
1367,"01:33:32,027","01:33:34,035",for some crazy ass peckerwood?
1368,"01:33:34,077","01:33:35,954",Yeah. Right.
1369,"01:33:35,996","01:33:38,164",Stupid.
1370,"01:33:43,837","01:33:45,505",That's what I thought.
1371,"01:33:49,843","01:33:52,095","I owe you, man."
1372,"01:33:52,137","01:33:54,306","Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?"
1373,"01:33:57,309","01:33:58,268","Yes, I do."
1374,"01:34:08,486","01:34:10,447",You'll be outta here in no time.
1375,"01:34:10,488","01:34:12,866","Man, it's a piece of cake, all right?"
1376,"01:34:15,118","01:34:16,953","Just take it easy on the brothers, all right?"
1377,"01:34:16,995","01:34:18,079",The brothers!
1378,"01:34:28,506","01:34:29,966","God, man."
1379,"01:34:32,510","01:34:34,346","Sorry, Derek."
1380,"01:34:35,347","01:34:37,515",Sorry that happened to you.
1381,"01:34:38,683","01:34:41,811","Well, I'm not. I'm lucky."
1382,"01:34:41,853","01:34:44,814","I feel lucky, 'cause it's wrong, Dan."
1383,"01:34:47,192","01:34:48,985","It's wrong, and it was eating me up."
1384,"01:34:49,027","01:34:50,987",It was gonna kill me.
1385,"01:34:51,029","01:34:53,031",And I kept asking myself all the time...
1386,"01:34:53,073","01:34:57,035","how did I buy into this shit, you know?"
1387,"01:34:58,703","01:35:00,538",It's just 'cause I was pissed off.
1388,"01:35:01,748","01:35:04,960",Nothing I ever did ever took that feeling away.
1389,"01:35:06,503","01:35:09,422","I killed two guys, Danny. I killed them."
1390,"01:35:11,299","01:35:13,468",And it didn't make me feel any different.
1391,"01:35:14,678","01:35:16,012",Just got me more lost...
1392,"01:35:16,054","01:35:18,515","and I'm tired of feeling pissed-off, Danny."
1393,"01:35:18,598","01:35:21,518",I'm just tired of it.
1394,"01:35:21,559","01:35:23,979",And I'm not telling you what to do.
1395,"01:35:25,313","01:35:26,648",I'm really not.
1396,"01:35:27,649","01:35:29,818",But I need you to understand...
1397,"01:35:31,653","01:35:34,990","'cause I love you, and you're my best friend."
1398,"01:35:37,117","01:35:38,994",Do you understand?
1399,"01:35:39,035","01:35:40,996","Yeah, I understand."
1400,"01:35:44,499","01:35:45,834",All right.
1401,"01:35:49,838","01:35:51,339",Jesus.
1402,"01:36:08,064","01:36:09,941",Hi. Everything OK?
1403,"01:36:09,983","01:36:11,359","Ah, everything's great."
1404,"01:36:11,401","01:36:14,154",Great. Yeah. You wanna sleep in our room?
1405,"01:36:14,195","01:36:16,156",- No. Thank you. - You sure?
1406,"01:36:16,197","01:36:19,451",Yeah. This is good. Thank you.
1407,"01:36:19,492","01:36:21,953","All right. Come on, let's go."
1408,"01:36:43,183","01:36:44,184",Good night.
1409,"01:37:51,167","01:37:53,003","I'm gonna take a shower, all right?"
1410,"01:38:27,203","01:38:28,455",It's hard to look back...
1411,"01:38:28,496","01:38:31,416",and see the truth about people you love.
1412,"01:38:31,458","01:38:34,419",I think if you asked Derek why it all went the way it did...
1413,"01:38:34,461","01:38:36,087",and where it all started...
1414,"01:38:36,129","01:38:38,965",he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.
1415,"01:38:40,133","01:38:42,427","The truth is, it started earlier."
1416,"01:38:42,469","01:38:45,680",Are we all meeting for the game tonight?
1417,"01:38:45,722","01:38:46,932",Definitely.
1418,"01:38:46,973","01:38:48,600","All right, Ben's Burger at 7:00..."
1419,"01:38:48,642","01:38:49,976",then we go watch the big guy play.
1420,"01:38:52,479","01:38:54,439",Psyching up for the game?
1421,"01:38:54,481","01:38:57,567",I'm always ready for that. I got an English exam.
1422,"01:38:57,651","01:38:59,945",I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.
1423,"01:38:59,986","01:39:01,988","What's the matter? Afraid you'll get a ""B""?"
1424,"01:39:02,030","01:39:04,950",Might do you good. B-minus.
1425,"01:39:04,991","01:39:07,911","Hey, don't laugh. This guy is different."
1426,"01:39:07,953","01:39:10,413",Dr. Sweeney. This guy's unbelievable.
1427,"01:39:10,455","01:39:12,457",Unbelievable. I've never had a teacher like this.
1428,"01:39:12,499","01:39:13,708",He's got two Ph. D.s.
1429,"01:39:13,750","01:39:17,379",I don't know what he's doing teaching at our school.
1430,"01:39:17,420","01:39:18,630",What's he got you reading?
1431,"01:39:18,672","01:39:22,300","We got this essay exam on ""Native Son."""
1432,"01:39:22,342","01:39:24,803","""Native Son""? I don't know that."
1433,"01:39:24,844","01:39:26,388",That's a big surprise.
1434,"01:39:27,514","01:39:28,890",What? I read.
1435,"01:39:30,141","01:39:33,478","Honey, they don't teach Tom Clancy in school."
1436,"01:39:35,146","01:39:36,940","Well, they don't."
1437,"01:39:36,982","01:39:38,441","So what is this ""Native Son""?"
1438,"01:39:39,609","01:39:41,987",It's this book about this black guy.
1439,"01:39:42,028","01:39:44,990",We're doing this whole black literature unit.
1440,"01:39:45,031","01:39:47,492",Is it Black History Month?
1441,"01:39:47,534","01:39:49,953","No, it's just this guy Sweeney, you know?"
1442,"01:39:49,995","01:39:51,830",It's part of the course now.
1443,"01:39:58,503","01:40:00,088",What?
1444,"01:40:00,130","01:40:02,966",Nothing. It's just...
1445,"01:40:03,008","01:40:05,093",It's everywhere I look now.
1446,"01:40:05,135","01:40:06,845",What?
1447,"01:40:08,513","01:40:11,308",This affirmative blacktion.
1448,"01:40:11,349","01:40:16,271",A few new books doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.
1449,"01:40:17,397","01:40:19,190","Read the book, ace the guy's test."
1450,"01:40:19,232","01:40:21,651",Just don't swallow everything he feeds you whole.
1451,"01:40:21,693","01:40:23,236",Just 'cause you see it on the evening news...
1452,"01:40:23,278","01:40:24,404","I know, but what?"
1453,"01:40:24,446","01:40:26,489",All this stuff about making everything equal.
1454,"01:40:26,531","01:40:27,991",It's not that simple.
1455,"01:40:28,033","01:40:29,993","Now you got this book ""Native Son."""
1456,"01:40:30,035","01:40:31,995",What happened to the other books in the course?
1457,"01:40:32,037","01:40:36,499",They're not any good anymore because Mr. Two PhD. says so?
1458,"01:40:36,541","01:40:39,002",Now you gotta trade in great books for black books?
1459,"01:40:39,044","01:40:41,671",Does that make sense?
1460,"01:40:41,713","01:40:43,840","You gotta question these things, Derek."
1461,"01:40:43,882","01:40:45,842",You gotta look at the whole picture.
1462,"01:40:45,884","01:40:49,054",We're talking about books here. I'm also talking about my job.
1463,"01:40:49,095","01:40:52,015",I got two black guys on my squad now...
1464,"01:40:52,057","01:40:54,517",who got their job over a couple of white guys...
1465,"01:40:54,559","01:40:56,603",who actually scored higher on the test.
1466,"01:40:56,645","01:41:00,023",Does that make sense?
1467,"01:41:00,065","01:41:03,610","Everything's equal now, but I got two guys watching my back..."
1468,"01:41:03,652","01:41:07,614",responsible for my life who aren't as good.
1469,"01:41:07,656","01:41:09,449",They only got the job because they were black...
1470,"01:41:09,491","01:41:11,785",not because they were the best.
1471,"01:41:11,826","01:41:14,871",- That sucks. - Is that what America's about?
1472,"01:41:14,955","01:41:16,957","No, America's about best man for the job."
1473,"01:41:16,998","01:41:19,125","You do your best, you get the job."
1474,"01:41:19,167","01:41:22,128",This affirmative-action crap...
1475,"01:41:22,170","01:41:23,964",I don't know what that's about.
1476,"01:41:24,005","01:41:28,134",There's like some hidden agenda or something going on.
1477,"01:41:28,176","01:41:29,636",You see what I'm saying?
1478,"01:41:29,678","01:41:32,264","Yeah, I do. I didn't think about it like that."
1479,"01:41:33,807","01:41:35,976","This guy, though-I don't know."
1480,"01:41:36,017","01:41:38,103","Dr. Sweeney, he comes on so strong..."
1481,"01:41:38,144","01:41:39,980",it's hard not to listen to him...
1482,"01:41:40,021","01:41:42,565",but maybe some of what he says is kinda...
1483,"01:41:42,607","01:41:43,817",It's bullshit.
1484,"01:41:45,026","01:41:47,153","Yeah. Yeah, maybe."
1485,"01:41:47,195","01:41:51,032",No. It's nigger bullshit.
1486,"01:41:53,368","01:41:56,121","- You see that, don't you? - Yeah."
1487,"01:41:56,162","01:41:57,998",You gotta watch out for that.
1488,"01:41:58,039","01:42:01,001","Yeah. No, I get what you're saying. I will."
1489,"01:42:02,544","01:42:04,462",Good boy.
1490,"01:42:04,504","01:42:06,589",I'm proud of you.
1491,"01:42:06,673","01:42:08,300",Don't worry about it. I got it.
1492,"01:44:13,967","01:44:15,927",And in about one minute...
1493,"01:44:15,969","01:44:18,513",I'm gonna watch the sun come up.
1494,"01:44:18,555","01:44:20,807",I don't know if I've ever done that.
1495,"01:44:21,975","01:44:25,312","Anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over."
1496,"01:44:25,353","01:44:28,773","It won't be easy, but we're all together again..."
1497,"01:44:28,808","01:44:30,900",and I feel good.
1498,"01:44:31,985","01:44:34,946",I'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted-
1499,"01:44:34,988","01:44:36,948",if I hit the social significance...
1500,"01:44:36,990","01:44:39,200",or whatever you're looking for...
1501,"01:44:39,242","01:44:42,746","but for what it's worth, thanks a lot."
1502,"01:44:57,260","01:45:01,514",Wow. You look great. Look at you.
1503,"01:45:03,183","01:45:06,144",Yeah. Gotta dress up for the parole officer.
1504,"01:45:06,186","01:45:07,479",Is she cute?
1505,"01:45:07,520","01:45:09,648",She is a fat guy named Hector...
1506,"01:45:09,689","01:45:12,943",- Oh. Well... - So I'm out of luck.
1507,"01:45:15,320","01:45:16,947",I just gotta check in...
1508,"01:45:16,988","01:45:19,074",then I'm gonna see about getting my old job back.
1509,"01:45:19,115","01:45:21,993",- Great. - Good morning.
1510,"01:45:23,203","01:45:24,454","Davina, can you help?"
1511,"01:45:24,496","01:45:25,956",Your sister's gonna help you.
1512,"01:45:26,998","01:45:28,708",You look great. Knock 'em dead.
1513,"01:45:28,750","01:45:30,293",Thanks.
1514,"01:45:30,335","01:45:32,754","Come on, sweetie. What would you like to wear today?"
1515,"01:45:35,382","01:45:38,593",- You do look good. - Yeah? I feel silly.
1516,"01:45:38,635","01:45:41,012",- You look good. - Yeah?
1517,"01:45:43,014","01:45:44,474",You feel good?
1518,"01:45:47,352","01:45:50,480","Yeah. I feel, you know..."
1519,"01:45:50,522","01:45:52,482",a little...
1520,"01:45:52,524","01:45:54,901",I'm getting there.
1521,"01:45:56,528","01:45:58,405",Listen... I don't know-
1522,"01:46:00,073","01:46:02,367",I don't know if it's OK that I'm here.
1523,"01:46:06,454","01:46:07,706",I want to be here.
1524,"01:46:26,474","01:46:28,226",- I'm gonna get a paper. - Cool.
1525,"01:46:45,660","01:46:48,788",- What do you want? - Maple bar and a large milk.
1526,"01:46:48,830","01:46:50,332",All right. I got it.
1527,"01:46:54,794","01:46:56,796",Let me get a coffee...
1528,"01:46:56,838","01:46:59,466","a maple bar, and a large milk to go."
1529,"01:46:59,507","01:47:00,550",Right away.
1530,"01:47:10,602","01:47:13,438","Derek, we need to talk."
1531,"01:47:13,480","01:47:14,905",What's going on?
1532,"01:47:14,940","01:47:19,402",Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan are at the ICU at St. John's.
1533,"01:47:19,486","01:47:20,946",They were jumped last night near Ben's Burgers.
1534,"01:47:20,981","01:47:22,746",How bad?
1535,"01:47:22,781","01:47:24,449","Well, it looks like they're gonna live."
1536,"01:47:24,491","01:47:27,577","- Then they got lucky. - Somebody's gotta lose, though."
1537,"01:47:30,372","01:47:31,373",What?
1538,"01:47:32,624","01:47:35,794",We were kinda hoping maybe you'd talk to your old crew-
1539,"01:47:35,835","01:47:37,420",Come on. No way.
1540,"01:47:37,504","01:47:40,632","If there's anybody they're gonna listen to, it's you."
1541,"01:47:40,667","01:47:42,884","No. I hate to tell you, but I'm out, OK?"
1542,"01:47:42,926","01:47:44,886",Those guys are probably gunning for me now.
1543,"01:47:44,928","01:47:46,930","We're asking for your help here, Derek."
1544,"01:47:46,972","01:47:48,848",Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
1545,"01:47:55,647","01:47:58,316",This has got nothing to do with me anymore.
1546,"01:47:58,351","01:48:01,003","Yes, it does. It has everything to do with you."
1547,"01:48:01,038","01:48:03,620","God, what are you doing to me? I'm doing my best!"
1548,"01:48:03,655","01:48:06,408",I'm going like this just to keep my family in the clear.
1549,"01:48:06,449","01:48:07,867",Don't ask me to fix this fucking situation!
1550,"01:48:07,909","01:48:09,869",- I'm not asking that. - It was there before me.
1551,"01:48:09,911","01:48:12,914",You helped create it. You wanna take a break now?
1552,"01:48:12,956","01:48:14,666","You take a break, you'll find no peace."
1553,"01:48:14,708","01:48:17,877",The way to find peace is to stick.
1554,"01:48:17,919","01:48:19,921",It's not gonna make a fucking bit of difference.
1555,"01:48:19,963","01:48:23,091",- It might. - Not a bit.
1556,"01:48:23,133","01:48:26,761","I mean, do you know what you're asking me to do?"
1557,"01:48:26,803","01:48:29,764",Yes. I'm asking you to do whatever's in your power to do.
1558,"01:48:31,266","01:48:33,560","Oh, man."
1559,"01:48:36,313","01:48:37,647",Fuck.
1560,"01:48:42,235","01:48:43,653",All right.
1561,"01:48:45,488","01:48:48,450",You know what you're gonna do? Get me shot by white boys.
1562,"01:48:48,491","01:48:50,452",I doubt it.
1563,"01:48:50,493","01:48:53,538","We're all gonna have a laugh at that, let me tell ya."
1564,"01:48:54,748","01:48:58,209",I'm gonna take him to school. I'll be back in half an hour.
1565,"01:48:58,244","01:48:59,628",Come on.
1566,"01:48:59,669","01:49:03,465","Hey, you. You got something good for me this morning?"
1567,"01:49:03,506","01:49:04,716","I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney."
1568,"01:49:04,758","01:49:06,051","- Yeah, OK. - All right."
1569,"01:49:10,847","01:49:12,849",What's going on?
1570,"01:49:17,938","01:49:19,105","Come on, let's go."
1571,"01:49:34,746","01:49:37,916","It's just so bad for Seth, man."
1572,"01:49:37,958","01:49:40,627",I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
1573,"01:49:41,920","01:49:44,297","I'm glad they're not dead. Other than that, I don't care."
1574,"01:49:45,799","01:49:47,259",Should we visit them?
1575,"01:49:47,300","01:49:49,928",No. Definitely not.
1576,"01:49:49,970","01:49:52,013",Just stay out of it.
1577,"01:49:52,055","01:49:55,934",Listen. I saw a car cruising by the house last night...
1578,"01:49:55,976","01:49:57,769",when I pulled out of there with Seth.
1579,"01:49:57,811","01:50:00,939","If you get home before me today, give a look around the street."
1580,"01:50:00,981","01:50:03,483",Make sure there's nothing going on.
1581,"01:50:04,484","01:50:06,569","Man, this is bad."
1582,"01:50:08,822","01:50:11,783","- They're after you, man. - It'll cool off."
1583,"01:50:11,825","01:50:15,370","If I made it through Chino, this should be a piece of cake."
1584,"01:50:17,664","01:50:18,665",You gonna be OK?
1585,"01:50:23,878","01:50:25,005",What are you gonna do?
1586,"01:50:25,046","01:50:28,466","I'll work it out. Keep your head up, all right?"
1587,"01:50:28,508","01:50:31,886",Things are gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.
1588,"01:50:31,928","01:50:33,763",Go turn that paper in.
1589,"01:50:35,515","01:50:38,685",All right. See ya.
1590,"01:50:38,727","01:50:40,020",Come here.
1591,"01:50:45,859","01:50:47,319",I'll see you at home.
1592,"01:50:49,070","01:50:50,614",All right?
1593,"01:50:51,865","01:50:54,451","Yeah, I'll see you. Good luck, all right?"
1594,"01:50:54,492","01:50:57,537",- Yeah. - See you later.
1595,"01:51:03,293","01:51:05,712",- Gonna be late. - We better go.
1596,"01:51:06,713","01:51:08,131",All right. Come on.
1597,"01:51:31,071","01:51:32,113",Bye.
1598,"01:51:32,155","01:51:35,367",I'll catch up with you. See you later.
1599,"01:52:57,115","01:52:58,950",Get out of my way!
1600,"01:52:58,992","01:53:00,785",All right! Let him go!
1601,"01:53:03,288","01:53:04,414","Oh, no."
1602,"01:53:07,542","01:53:09,628","Aw, Jesus."
1603,"01:53:33,151","01:53:34,951","Oh, Jesus."
1604,"01:53:34,986","01:53:36,988","God, what did I do?"
1605,"01:54:05,141","01:54:09,104",So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned.
1606,"01:54:09,145","01:54:10,981","My conclusion, right?"
1607,"01:54:11,982","01:54:15,902","Well, my conclusion is hate is baggage."
1608,"01:54:16,736","01:54:19,948",Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.
1609,"01:54:19,990","01:54:22,158",It's just not worth it.
1610,"01:54:24,911","01:54:28,456",Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
1611,"01:54:28,498","01:54:30,959",He says someone else has already said it best...
1612,"01:54:31,001","01:54:32,961",so if you can't top it...
1613,"01:54:33,003","01:54:35,463",steal from them and go out strong.
1614,"01:54:35,505","01:54:38,008",So I picked a guy I thought you'd like.
1615,"01:54:39,843","01:54:43,471","""We are not enemies, but friends."
1616,"01:54:43,513","01:54:45,807","""We must not be enemies."
1617,"01:54:45,849","01:54:48,310","""Though passion may have strained..."
1618,"01:54:48,351","01:54:51,146","""we must not break our bonds of affection."
1619,"01:54:51,187","01:54:53,982","""The mystic chords of memory..."
1620,"01:54:54,024","01:54:56,526","""will swell when again touched..."
1621,"01:54:56,568","01:54:58,528","""as surely they will be..."
1622,"01:54:58,570","01:55:01,531","""by the better angels of our nature."""
