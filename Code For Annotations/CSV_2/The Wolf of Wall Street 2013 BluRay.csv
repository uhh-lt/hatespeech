142,"00:08:27,255","00:08:29,966","Well, Hector, here's the game plan."
143,"00:08:30,050","00:08:32,511",You're gonna bring us two Absolut martinis.
144,"00:08:32,594","00:08:34,137",You know how I like them. Straight up.
145,"00:08:34,221","00:08:36,848","And then precisely seven and one half minutes after that,"
146,"00:08:36,932","00:08:38,266",you're gonna bring us two more.
147,"00:08:38,392","00:08:41,645",Then two more after that every five minutes
148,"00:08:41,728","00:08:43,939",until one of us passes the fuck out.
149,"00:08:45,190","00:08:46,650","Excellent strategy, sir."
150,"00:08:46,775","00:08:48,568",I'm good with water for now.

154,"00:08:56,743","00:08:57,786",Mr. Hanna?
155,"00:08:58,412","00:09:04,167","You're able to do drugs during the day and then still function, still do your job?"
156,"00:09:04,251","00:09:06,086",How the fuck else would you do this job?
157,"00:09:06,169","00:09:08,338","Cocaine and hookers, my friend."
158,"00:09:08,463","00:09:09,840",Right.
159,"00:09:10,841","00:09:15,637","Well, I got to say, I'm incredibly excited to be a part of your firm. I mean..."
160,"00:09:16,221","00:09:17,597",The clients you have are absolutely...
161,"00:09:17,681","00:09:19,141",Fuck the clients.
162,"00:09:19,725","00:09:22,978",Your only responsibility is to put meat on the table.
163,"00:09:24,062","00:09:25,313",You got a girlfriend?
164,"00:09:25,397","00:09:26,940",I'm married. I have a wife.

166,"00:09:29,192","00:09:30,485",- Congratulations. - Thank you.
167,"00:09:30,569","00:09:31,903",Think about Teresa.
168,"00:09:31,987","00:09:33,155",Name of the game.
169,"00:09:33,280","00:09:37,075",Move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket.
170,"00:09:37,200","00:09:38,243",Right.
171,"00:09:38,326","00:09:39,995","But if you make your clients money at the same time,"
172,"00:09:40,078","00:09:42,330",it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?
173,"00:09:43,081","00:09:44,166",No.
174,"00:09:45,167","00:09:47,169",Number one rule of Wall Street.
175,"00:09:48,003","00:09:49,337",Nobody...
176,"00:09:49,463","00:09:51,590",I don't care if you're Warren Buffett or if you're Jimmy Buffett.
177,"00:09:51,673","00:09:56,303","Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up, down, sideways, or in fucking circles."
178,"00:09:56,386","00:09:58,388","Least of all stockbrokers, right?"
179,"00:09:58,472","00:10:01,057",It's all a fugazi. You know what a fugazi is?
180,"00:10:01,141","00:10:03,518",Fugayzi. It's a fake.
181,"00:10:03,643","00:10:06,021","Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's..."
182,"00:10:06,104","00:10:08,440",Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.
183,"00:10:08,523","00:10:11,943",It's never landed. It is no matter. It's not on the elemental chart.
184,"00:10:12,027","00:10:14,029",It's not fucking real.
185,"00:10:14,112","00:10:15,947",- Right? - Right.
186,"00:10:16,072","00:10:17,741",Stay with me.
187,"00:10:17,866","00:10:20,118",We don't create shit. We don't build anything.
188,"00:10:20,243","00:10:21,369",No.
189,"00:10:21,453","00:10:24,289",So if you got a client who bought stock at 8
190,"00:10:24,372","00:10:26,792","and it now sits at 16, he's all fucking happy."
191,"00:10:26,875","00:10:29,961","He wants to cash in, liquidate, take his fucking money and run home."
192,"00:10:30,045","00:10:32,005",- You don't let him do that. - Okay.
193,"00:10:32,130","00:10:33,965",- 'Cause that would make it real. - Right.
194,"00:10:34,049","00:10:35,300",No. What do you do?
195,"00:10:35,383","00:10:37,344",You get another brilliant idea.
196,"00:10:37,469","00:10:38,887",A special idea.
197,"00:10:38,970","00:10:43,558","Another ""situation."" Another stock to reinvest his earnings and then some."
198,"00:10:43,642","00:10:45,894","And he will, every single time."
199,"00:10:46,019","00:10:48,063",'Cause they're fucking addicted.
200,"00:10:48,230","00:10:51,233","And you just keep doing this, again and again and again."
201,"00:10:51,316","00:10:53,985","Meanwhile, he thinks he's getting shit rich,"
202,"00:10:54,069","00:10:56,154","which he is, on paper."
203,"00:10:56,238","00:10:57,906","But you and me, the brokers,"
204,"00:10:58,031","00:11:02,118","we're taking home cold hard cash via commission, motherfucker."
205,"00:11:02,744","00:11:03,912",Right.
206,"00:11:05,497","00:11:08,583","That's incredible, sir. I can't tell you how excited I am."
207,"00:11:08,750","00:11:10,126",You should be.
208,"00:11:10,210","00:11:13,964",There's two keys to success in the broker business.
209,"00:11:14,089","00:11:15,632",First of all...
210,"00:11:17,425","00:11:19,678",- You gotta stay relaxed. - Yeah.
211,"00:11:19,761","00:11:20,887",Do you jerk off?
212,"00:11:22,430","00:11:24,015",Do I... Do I jerk off?
213,"00:11:24,099","00:11:26,309","Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah."
214,"00:11:26,393","00:11:27,686",How many times a week?
215,"00:11:28,770","00:11:30,355",Like three or four.
216,"00:11:30,438","00:11:32,732","- Three or four times, maybe five. - Gotta pump those numbers up."
217,"00:11:32,816","00:11:35,318",Those are rookie numbers in this racket.
218,"00:11:35,443","00:11:39,072","I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day."
219,"00:11:39,698","00:11:40,866",- Wow. - Once in the morning
220,"00:11:40,949","00:11:43,410","right after I work out, then once right after lunch."
221,"00:11:43,493","00:11:44,870",Really?
222,"00:11:45,453","00:11:47,873",I want to. That's not why I do it.
223,"00:11:47,998","00:11:50,083",I do it 'cause I fucking need to.
224,"00:11:51,084","00:11:52,669",Think about it. You're dealing with numbers.
225,"00:11:52,752","00:11:55,714","All day long, decimal points, high frequencies."
226,"00:11:55,797","00:11:56,840","Bang, bang, bang."
227,"00:11:57,799","00:11:59,134",Fucking digits.
228,"00:11:59,885","00:12:02,637",All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit.
229,"00:12:02,721","00:12:03,972",All right?
230,"00:12:04,097","00:12:06,558",It kind of wigs some people out. Right.
231,"00:12:06,641","00:12:08,768",You got to feed the geese to keep the blood flowing.
232,"00:12:08,852","00:12:10,520",I keep the rhythm below the belt.
233,"00:12:10,645","00:12:11,855",Done.
234,"00:12:11,938","00:12:13,607","This is not a tip, this is a prescription."
235,"00:12:13,690","00:12:14,858",Trust me.
236,"00:12:14,983","00:12:17,444","If you don't, you will fall out of balance,"
237,"00:12:17,527","00:12:19,654",split your differential and tip the fuck over.
238,"00:12:19,738","00:12:21,031","Or worse yet,"
239,"00:12:21,114","00:12:23,325","I've seen this happen, implode."
240,"00:12:23,408","00:12:24,868","No, I don't want to implode, sir."
241,"00:12:24,951","00:12:26,119","No. No, you don't."
242,"00:12:26,202","00:12:27,454","I'm in it for the long run, you know?"
243,"00:12:27,537","00:12:29,122",- Implosions are ugly. - Yeah.
244,"00:12:29,205","00:12:31,374","Pop off to the bathroom, work one out any time you can."
245,"00:12:31,458","00:12:32,459","When you get really good at it,"
246,"00:12:32,542","00:12:35,670",you'll fucking be stroking it and you'll be thinking about money.
247,"00:12:36,338","00:12:40,842",Second key to success in this racket
248,"00:12:40,926","00:12:42,177",is this little baby right here.
249,"00:12:42,260","00:12:43,637",It's called cocaine.
250,"00:12:43,720","00:12:45,013",Right.
251,"00:12:45,096","00:12:48,934",It'll keep you sharp between the ears. It'll also help your fingers dial faster.
252,"00:12:49,017","00:12:50,393",And guess what?
253,"00:12:50,477","00:12:52,020",That's good for me.
254,"00:12:52,771","00:12:54,022","Yes, sir."
255,"00:12:54,814","00:12:56,274",Revolutions. You follow?
256,"00:12:56,358","00:12:57,442",Revolutions.
257,"00:12:57,525","00:12:59,778",Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.
258,"00:12:59,861","00:13:03,406","And it goes. The park is open 24/7, 365,"
259,"00:13:03,490","00:13:06,409","every decade, every goddamn century."
260,"00:13:06,534","00:13:07,911",That's it.
261,"00:13:08,536","00:13:09,704",The name of the game.
262,"00:13:11,247","00:13:12,290",Halkidiki?
263,"00:13:12,374","00:13:13,500",Thank you.
264,"00:13:25,887","00:13:26,930",Come on.
265,"00:13:32,060","00:13:34,062",We're the common denominator.
266,"00:13:42,654","00:13:44,155",Keep it up for me.
267,"00:13:44,239","00:13:46,157",<i>You've seen the echo</i>
268,"00:13:46,241","00:13:47,784",<i>And the money comes in</i>
269,"00:13:48,368","00:13:50,286",<i>The parade comes to town</i>

276,"00:14:12,434","00:14:13,810","Oh, fuckers."

278,"00:14:24,779","00:14:26,740",<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

292,"00:15:08,615","00:15:10,158",You know what happened? A fucking tsunami.
293,"00:15:10,283","00:15:11,534",I think you're making a big mistake.

435,"00:20:50,665","00:20:54,085",is that I never ask my clients to judge me on my winners.
436,"00:20:54,293","00:20:57,755",I ask them to judge me on my losers because I have so few.
437,"00:20:57,880","00:20:59,424","And in the case of Aerotyne,"
438,"00:20:59,507","00:21:02,135","based on every technical factor out there, John,"

494,"00:23:01,629","00:23:03,464",Last month. Something like that.

530,"00:24:31,302","00:24:32,386","It's not like, what... You know."
531,"00:24:32,511","00:24:34,013","Look, we grew up together."
532,"00:24:34,096","00:24:36,474","And she grew up hot, you know. She fucking grew up hot."
533,"00:24:36,557","00:24:38,309","And all my friends were trying to fuck her, you know."
534,"00:24:38,392","00:24:40,269",And I'm not gonna let someone...
535,"00:24:40,394","00:24:41,937","You know, one of these assholes fuck my cousin,"
536,"00:24:42,021","00:24:45,483","so, you know, I used the cousin thing as like an in with her."
537,"00:24:45,608","00:24:48,069",I'm not gonna let someone else fuck my cousin.
538,"00:24:48,152","00:24:49,820","You know, if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,"

540,"00:24:51,864","00:24:52,990","No, I get it. Yeah."
541,"00:24:53,074","00:24:55,242","I mean, you're not afraid of like the whole kid thing, right?"
542,"00:24:55,368","00:24:56,535",- What? Having kids with her? - Yeah.
543,"00:24:56,619","00:24:57,828",No. We have two kids.
544,"00:24:58,079","00:24:59,372",And they're... I mean...

546,"00:25:02,124","00:25:04,251","No, they're not retarded or anything like that."
547,"00:25:04,418","00:25:06,253","But there's a big chance, right, if..."
548,"00:25:06,337","00:25:08,673","Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,"
549,"00:25:08,756","00:25:12,259",60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.
550,"00:25:12,343","00:25:13,427","That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy."
551,"00:25:13,552","00:25:15,846","Look, man, a lot of having a kid, or whatever, takes risk,"
552,"00:25:15,930","00:25:17,682",whether you're fucking cousins or not.
553,"00:25:17,765","00:25:20,518",What if something like that happened?
554,"00:25:20,601","00:25:22,186","Basically, you know, if the kid was retarded,"
555,"00:25:22,269","00:25:25,564","I would, you know, drive it up to the country"
556,"00:25:25,648","00:25:27,316","and just, like, you know, open the door and say,"
557,"00:25:27,441","00:25:29,610","""You're free now."" You know, like, ""Run free."""

561,"00:25:42,039","00:25:43,624",You look like you've... No.
562,"00:25:43,708","00:25:45,543","We would take it to, like, an institution or somewhere"

564,"00:25:48,879","00:25:51,048","You know what? If you're happy, God bless you, buddy."
565,"00:25:51,132","00:25:54,468","No, I'm not fucking happy. No one who's married is fucking happy."

644,"00:29:09,163","00:29:11,248","Yeah, like Buddhists. They don't give a shit about money."
645,"00:29:11,332","00:29:13,334",They're wrapped in sheets. They're not buying shit.
646,"00:29:13,417","00:29:15,169",I'm not talking about Buddhists or Amish.

649,"00:29:20,090","00:29:21,383",There's no such thing as an Amish Buddhist.
650,"00:29:21,467","00:29:23,344",- I'm pretty fucking sure. - There could be.

658,"00:29:35,856","00:29:37,691",That's the attitude. You can sell anything?
659,"00:29:37,775","00:29:39,360",Sell me this fucking pen right here.

665,"00:29:49,370","00:29:50,829",You want me to sell this fucking pen?
666,"00:29:50,913","00:29:53,415",That's my boy right there. Can fucking sell anything.
667,"00:29:53,499","00:29:54,500",Why don't you do me a favor.
668,"00:29:54,583","00:29:56,251",Write your name down on that napkin for me.
669,"00:29:56,335","00:29:57,378",I don't have a pen.
670,"00:29:57,461","00:29:59,171","Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend."
671,"00:29:59,254","00:30:00,339",- Holy shit. - See what I'm saying?
672,"00:30:00,422","00:30:01,799",He's creating urgency.
673,"00:30:01,966","00:30:03,342",Get them to want to buy the stock.
674,"00:30:03,425","00:30:05,302","Convince them it's something they need, you know what I mean?"
675,"00:30:05,386","00:30:06,553",And that's the thing.
676,"00:30:06,637","00:30:08,138",All nuns are lesbians.
677,"00:30:08,389","00:30:10,140","What the fuck are you talking about, Otter?"
678,"00:30:10,224","00:30:13,018",Think about it. They can't keep a dude so they're gonna start fucking chicks.
679,"00:30:13,102","00:30:15,229","Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times."
680,"00:30:15,396","00:30:16,772",- He's not with us. - Friggin' Rambo.

706,"00:31:17,124","00:31:18,459","Yeah, they're terrible."
707,"00:31:19,334","00:31:22,004","Don't worry about it. I told you, what I'm doing is completely legal."
708,"00:31:22,129","00:31:23,172","Yeah, I know."
709,"00:31:23,255","00:31:25,382","But they're not gonna make anyone money though, right?"
710,"00:31:26,258","00:31:28,260","Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't."
711,"00:31:28,343","00:31:29,762",You know how it goes.
712,"00:31:29,970","00:31:32,389",Wouldn't you feel better if you sold that stuff to rich people
713,"00:31:32,473","00:31:35,434","who can, like, afford to lose all that money?"
714,"00:31:36,643","00:31:37,644",Of course.
715,"00:31:38,812","00:31:40,856",But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

750,"00:33:07,526","00:33:09,236",What we're gonna do is this.
751,"00:33:09,319","00:33:14,491","First we pitch 'em Disney, AT&T, IBM, blue chip stocks exclusively."
752,"00:33:14,575","00:33:16,743",Companies these people know.
753,"00:33:16,994","00:33:20,873","Once we've suckered them in, we unload the dog shit."
754,"00:33:20,998","00:33:24,668","The pink sheets, the penny stocks, where we make the money."
755,"00:33:24,918","00:33:26,920","50% commission, baby."
756,"00:33:27,254","00:33:30,007",Now the key to making money in a situation like this
757,"00:33:30,090","00:33:33,093",is to position yourself now before the settlement.
758,"00:33:33,302","00:33:36,096","Because by the time you read about it in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>"
759,"00:33:36,180","00:33:38,056",It's already too late.
760,"00:33:38,807","00:33:40,267",Then you wait.

762,"00:33:41,518","00:33:44,104",And whoever speaks first loses.

767,"00:33:54,740","00:33:56,033","They don't know, right? They gotta think about it,"
768,"00:33:56,116","00:33:58,493","they gotta talk to their fucking wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy."
769,"00:33:58,577","00:34:00,370","Point is, it doesn't matter what the fuck they say."
770,"00:34:00,454","00:34:03,957",The only real objection that they have is that they don't trust you guys.
771,"00:34:04,041","00:34:05,667","And why should they trust you? I mean, look at you."
772,"00:34:05,792","00:34:07,502","You're a bunch of fucking sleazy salesmen, right?"
773,"00:34:08,795","00:34:10,297","So, what do you say?"
774,"00:34:10,380","00:34:13,550",You mean to tell me that if I put you in at Union Carbide at 7

785,"00:34:34,404","00:34:36,949",Let me introduce myself to you. My name is Alden Kupferberg.

790,"00:34:44,248","00:34:46,166","And I'm not gonna get there by being wrong, Stanley."

793,"00:34:50,170","00:34:52,422",<i>It's not gonna make you rich and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>
794,"00:34:52,506","00:34:54,967",But what this trade will do is serve as...
795,"00:34:55,050","00:34:57,302","a benchmark for future business, Kevin."
796,"00:34:57,427","00:34:59,221","You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?"
797,"00:34:59,346","00:35:00,597",And then you'll know for sure
798,"00:35:00,681","00:35:02,724",that you finally found a broker on Wall Street
799,"00:35:02,808","00:35:04,351","that you can trust,"
800,"00:35:04,434","00:35:08,021",and who can consistently make you money.
801,"00:35:08,188","00:35:09,523",Sound fair enough?
802,"00:35:11,692","00:35:13,527",<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>
803,"00:35:14,403","00:35:16,488","<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i>"

805,"00:35:19,408","00:35:20,492",Kevin.
806,"00:35:21,076","00:35:22,953",You give me one shot here

808,"00:35:25,747","00:35:27,958","and believe me, Kevin,"
809,"00:35:28,041","00:35:30,544",the only problem you're gonna have
810,"00:35:30,627","00:35:33,046",is that you didn't buy more.
811,"00:35:33,213","00:35:34,715",Sound fair enough?
812,"00:35:36,216","00:35:37,259",<i>Shit. My...</i>
813,"00:35:41,179","00:35:42,806","<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>"

815,"00:35:45,726","00:35:47,144","Excellent choice, Kevin."
816,"00:35:47,227","00:35:49,062",How much do you want to go for this time?
817,"00:35:49,229","00:35:51,106","<i>Let's do five... $5,000.</i>"
818,"00:35:51,189","00:35:52,357","Can we try 8,000, Kevin?"
819,"00:35:52,441","00:35:53,775",<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>
820,"00:35:54,067","00:35:55,152",- Ten. <i>- You want to do that?</i>
821,"00:35:55,235","00:35:56,236",Excellent choice!

823,"00:35:59,197","00:36:00,490","with an exact confirmation, Kevin."
824,"00:36:00,574","00:36:03,160",And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.
825,"00:36:03,243","00:36:05,412","<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i>"

829,"00:36:10,667","00:36:12,586",Fuck that motherfucker!
830,"00:36:12,794","00:36:14,546",That's what I'm talking about!
831,"00:36:18,008","00:36:19,301",What a fucking idiot.
832,"00:36:19,551","00:36:22,846",The one thing I know about in this world is airlines.
833,"00:36:23,180","00:36:26,308",And Cuchon Airlines is the future of airlines.

835,"00:36:27,726","00:36:29,353",- I'm Nicky Koskoff... - Chester Ming...

837,"00:36:32,689","00:36:36,151","Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss."

840,"00:36:38,862","00:36:39,905",And the stock goes down a couple points...

935,"00:42:33,758","00:42:35,051","<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i>"
936,"00:42:35,135","00:42:37,595",<i>which was pretty amazing considering she blew</i>
937,"00:42:37,679","00:42:39,973",<i>every single guy in the office.</i>
938,"00:42:40,223","00:42:43,309",<i>Then he got depressed and killed himself three years later.</i>
939,"00:42:43,560","00:42:47,856","<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max, to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i>"
940,"00:42:47,939","00:42:49,607",<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>
941,"00:42:51,484","00:42:54,487","<i>We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>"
942,"00:42:54,571","00:42:58,491",<i>which could be set off by something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.</i>
943,"00:42:59,659","00:43:02,287",Who the fuck has the goddamn gall
944,"00:43:02,370","00:43:04,998",to call this house on a Tuesday night?
945,"00:43:05,248","00:43:07,250",God damn it!
946,"00:43:07,333","00:43:08,376",You're gonna miss it!
947,"00:43:08,460","00:43:10,295","Please, tell me something I don't know."
948,"00:43:10,378","00:43:13,131",I wait all week for the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>
949,"00:43:13,214","00:43:15,508",and they have to fucking... Hello.
950,"00:43:15,592","00:43:17,302",<i>But as soon as he picked up the phone...</i>
951,"00:43:17,385","00:43:18,678","Gene. How are you, Gene?"
952,"00:43:18,803","00:43:20,722",<i>He'd affect this weird British accent.</i>
953,"00:43:20,805","00:43:23,016","Right-o, Gene, that'd be great."
954,"00:43:23,141","00:43:24,309",Cheerio.
955,"00:43:24,392","00:43:25,435",<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>
956,"00:43:25,518","00:43:27,061",The fucking halfwit!
957,"00:43:27,145","00:43:28,188",<i>- He'd hang up...</i> - You missed it!
958,"00:43:28,271","00:43:30,523",<i>And then he's Mad Max all over again.</i>
959,"00:43:30,648","00:43:31,649",Damn it!
960,"00:43:31,775","00:43:33,943","All right, tell me what happened. What happened?"
961,"00:43:34,110","00:43:36,154","Well, he discovered it was the mother's sister."
962,"00:43:36,237","00:43:37,655",Who's he? Who? Tell me who...
963,"00:43:37,739","00:43:39,324",The main guy. You know who the main...
964,"00:43:39,407","00:43:40,492",The main guy...
965,"00:43:40,575","00:43:42,911",It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead.
966,"00:43:44,370","00:43:45,955","<i>Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know</i>"
967,"00:43:46,039","00:43:47,707",<i>everything we were doing at Stratton.</i>
968,"00:43:47,916","00:43:49,834",And then there's a big target and we...
969,"00:43:50,043","00:43:51,878",They get launched at the target. They stick.
970,"00:43:52,003","00:43:54,088",<i>There's a bull's-eye and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>
971,"00:43:54,172","00:43:55,256",<i>Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign</i>
972,"00:43:55,340","00:43:56,299",gets the most points.
973,"00:43:56,382","00:43:58,593",I'm gonna throw the shit out of this little fucking thing.
974,"00:43:58,676","00:44:00,595","So if it gets hurt, what happens?"
975,"00:44:00,678","00:44:01,971",'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.
976,"00:44:02,055","00:44:03,306",I don't think he's gonna get hurt. They're like...
977,"00:44:03,389","00:44:05,141",They got like superhuman strength.
978,"00:44:05,225","00:44:06,434",I think he's gonna be fine.
979,"00:44:06,518","00:44:08,478",You can't look him right in the eyes.
980,"00:44:08,561","00:44:09,687",You can't look him in the eye?
981,"00:44:09,771","00:44:11,439",That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.
982,"00:44:11,606","00:44:13,399",They get confused and their wires get crossed.
983,"00:44:13,483","00:44:15,026",You gotta look at their chin.
984,"00:44:15,109","00:44:16,152",Like it looks like I'm looking at you
985,"00:44:16,236","00:44:17,237",but I'm looking at your chin.
986,"00:44:17,320","00:44:19,489","I feel like you're addressing me right now, but you're not, are you?"
987,"00:44:19,572","00:44:21,449","They're like the <i>Mona Lisa.</i> They find eye contact,"
988,"00:44:21,533","00:44:23,076","like, wherever you are standing in the room."
989,"00:44:23,243","00:44:24,369",And they lock in.
990,"00:44:24,577","00:44:27,080","No, but there is a limit to what we can do with them?"
991,"00:44:27,163","00:44:28,289",We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.
992,"00:44:28,414","00:44:29,791",We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.
993,"00:44:29,916","00:44:31,334",Any food. Correct.
994,"00:44:31,417","00:44:32,460","But, for example, what I wouldn't do is"
995,"00:44:32,544","00:44:34,295",maybe like tell him to pull his cock out
996,"00:44:34,379","00:44:36,089","and like get some of the girls to, you know,"
997,"00:44:36,214","00:44:37,257",fondle him and shit like that.
998,"00:44:37,340","00:44:38,341",That would be... That's unacceptable?
999,"00:44:38,424","00:44:39,425",Let's keep that in our back pocket.
1000,"00:44:39,509","00:44:41,511",This guy is more about throwing at the dartboard.
1001,"00:44:41,594","00:44:42,595","Correct. Yes, yes, yes."
1002,"00:44:42,720","00:44:44,055","The thing is, this is their gift, okay."
1003,"00:44:44,138","00:44:46,182",They're built to be thrown like a lawn dart.
1004,"00:44:46,266","00:44:47,475",They're top heavy like a lawn dart.
1005,"00:44:47,559","00:44:48,560",So they're built for accuracy.
1006,"00:44:48,643","00:44:50,603","Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?"
1007,"00:44:50,770","00:44:51,771","That's his fucking brother, Rob."
1008,"00:44:51,855","00:44:53,189",His brother's the bowling ball.
1009,"00:44:53,273","00:44:54,983","The brother, you put a skateboard on him,"
1010,"00:44:55,066","00:44:56,359","you strap him to a skateboard,"
1011,"00:44:56,442","00:44:57,819",you toss him down an alley at some pins.
1012,"00:44:57,902","00:44:59,529",- No shit. That's interesting. - Swear to fucking God.
1013,"00:44:59,612","00:45:01,614","- Can we get that guy? - Yeah, we'll get that guy, too."
1014,"00:45:01,698","00:45:03,783",But it says here this guy will show his cock. Yeah.
1015,"00:45:03,867","00:45:05,118",- Instead of growing up. Yeah. - He will?
1016,"00:45:05,201","00:45:06,494","They are very ornery by the way,"
1017,"00:45:06,578","00:45:07,954",so you gotta be very careful with these little guys.
1018,"00:45:08,037","00:45:09,080",Safety first.
1019,"00:45:09,163","00:45:10,248","Safety is first, all right?"
1020,"00:45:10,331","00:45:12,208",I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer gun
1021,"00:45:12,292","00:45:13,918",ready to knock this fucker out.
1022,"00:45:14,002","00:45:16,170",- Do we want to get like a... - Mace. Taser guns.
1023,"00:45:16,254","00:45:17,255",A pellet gun maybe?
1024,"00:45:17,338","00:45:18,464","No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him."
1025,"00:45:18,548","00:45:19,883",I just want him out. Knocked out cold.
1026,"00:45:20,049","00:45:22,552",But I say we stick with the loophole. Right? Okay?
1027,"00:45:22,802","00:45:24,554","If we don't consider him a human,"
1028,"00:45:24,637","00:45:26,764","we just consider it an act, I think we're in the clear."
1029,"00:45:26,848","00:45:27,891",Like The Flying Wallendas.
1030,"00:45:27,974","00:45:29,934","You know, a lot of those guys died but they never sued anybody."
1031,"00:45:30,018","00:45:31,769",The important thing you guys gotta keep in mind
1032,"00:45:31,853","00:45:33,688",is that these things gossip.
1033,"00:45:33,813","00:45:35,398",They get together and they gossip.
1034,"00:45:35,481","00:45:36,858",- That's a good point. - And the last thing
1035,"00:45:36,941","00:45:39,110","that we need is them getting together and saying,"
1036,"00:45:39,193","00:45:40,778","""Oh, they made fun of us."""
1037,"00:45:40,862","00:45:42,447","Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad."
1038,"00:45:42,530","00:45:44,616",That's why I love you. You think of shit like that.
1039,"00:45:44,699","00:45:47,702","When they come in, we treat it just like one of us. Okay?"
1040,"00:45:47,952","00:45:51,080","One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us."
1041,"00:45:51,205","00:45:52,749","We accept them, one of us!"
1042,"00:45:52,916","00:45:54,542","Gooble gobble, one of us."
1043,"00:45:54,667","00:45:55,960","We accept them, one of us."
1044,"00:45:56,044","00:45:57,086","Gooble gobble, one of us!"
1045,"00:45:57,170","00:45:58,463",Jordan! Your dad's coming.
1046,"00:45:58,546","00:46:00,006",Something about the American Express bill.
1047,"00:46:00,173","00:46:01,257",Can you get him out of here?
1048,"00:46:01,382","00:46:02,508",Yeah. Lick my twat.
1049,"00:46:02,675","00:46:03,843","No, I'm serious!"
1050,"00:46:04,552","00:46:06,262","Fuck. Guys, act like we're working."
1051,"00:46:06,346","00:46:07,805",You got any fucking stock forms?
1052,"00:46:08,264","00:46:09,432","He's coming, he's coming."
1053,"00:46:09,515","00:46:10,683",Make some shit up.
1054,"00:46:11,225","00:46:12,769",I think if we short Pfizer...
1055,"00:46:13,227","00:46:17,774","$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?"
1056,"00:46:18,024","00:46:23,196","Four hundred and fucking 30,000 fucking dollars in one fucking month!"
1057,"00:46:23,279","00:46:25,448",Good morning. They're business expenses. Relax.
1058,"00:46:25,531","00:46:26,741",- Business expenses? - Yes.
1059,"00:46:26,824","00:46:28,242","- Jordy, look what you got here. - What?"
1060,"00:46:28,326","00:46:32,205","Look at this. $26,000 for one fucking dinner!"
1061,"00:46:32,372","00:46:33,998","Okay. No, no. This could be explained."
1062,"00:46:34,290","00:46:36,501","Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients."
1063,"00:46:36,793","00:46:38,461",Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.
1064,"00:46:38,544","00:46:40,797",Expensive champagne and... We had to buy champagne.
1065,"00:46:40,880","00:46:42,382",And you ordered all the fucking sides.
1066,"00:46:42,465","00:46:44,425","- Tell him about the sides. - I ordered sides, so..."
1067,"00:46:44,509","00:46:47,971","Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?"
1068,"00:46:48,388","00:46:50,390",What are these sides? They cure cancer?
1069,"00:46:50,556","00:46:52,350",The sides did cure cancer. That's the problem.
1070,"00:46:52,433","00:46:53,851",That's why they were expensive.
1071,"00:46:54,268","00:46:55,853",- Shut the fuck up. - I'm serious.
1072,"00:46:56,020","00:46:57,939",- Stop. - And EJ Entertainment?
1073,"00:46:58,022","00:46:59,816",What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?
1074,"00:47:01,025","00:47:02,652","Well, that's..."
1075,"00:47:02,735","00:47:03,820","Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?"
1076,"00:47:03,903","00:47:04,988",How do I describe this?
1077,"00:47:05,071","00:47:06,072","Jord, what is that?"
1078,"00:47:06,155","00:47:08,241","- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy! - I know."
1079,"00:47:08,366","00:47:10,410",- That's what it is! - That is what it is.
1080,"00:47:10,535","00:47:12,495",Isn't that the perfect description for it?
1081,"00:47:12,578","00:47:15,164",That is what it is. But none of these were charged to me.
1082,"00:47:15,248","00:47:16,582",This is all of them.
1083,"00:47:16,708","00:47:18,459","- Oh, that was all us? - It wasn't me though."
1084,"00:47:18,543","00:47:20,378",Fucking explain this shit to him!
1085,"00:47:20,545","00:47:23,423",These are all of your fucking charges right here!
1086,"00:47:23,548","00:47:25,675","The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine."
1087,"00:47:25,758","00:47:26,926",T&E!
1088,"00:47:27,010","00:47:28,094",T&E!
1089,"00:47:28,177","00:47:29,220",Yeah. I said T&E.
1090,"00:47:29,303","00:47:30,596","- No, no. You said T&A. - No, I didn't."
1091,"00:47:30,680","00:47:31,681","Yeah, you did."
1092,"00:47:31,764","00:47:34,058",- When did I say that? - You said T&A. It's T&E.
1093,"00:47:34,142","00:47:35,435","I know you're upset about the dinner,"
1094,"00:47:35,518","00:47:39,814",and that makes sense because we did spend too much money. But I said T&E.
1095,"00:47:39,897","00:47:41,524",Don't tell me what you said. I heard what you said.
1096,"00:47:41,607","00:47:42,900",- Dad. He said T&A. - He did?
1097,"00:47:42,984","00:47:44,360","Absolutely, no question."
1098,"00:47:44,444","00:47:45,570",I'm trying to...
1099,"00:47:45,653","00:47:46,696",I'm getting this close!
1100,"00:47:46,779","00:47:47,989","- Dad, relax. - I'm getting this close."
1101,"00:47:48,072","00:47:50,533","That's what I'm saying. I want you to open up more, Max."
1102,"00:47:50,616","00:47:51,659",He's gonna fucking kill you.
1103,"00:47:51,743","00:47:53,286",Why do you hold it in? Why do you...
1104,"00:47:53,453","00:47:55,079","Max, why do you hold it in?"
1105,"00:47:55,163","00:47:56,873",That's it. Get the fuck out of here!
1106,"00:47:56,998","00:47:59,292","- No, no, no! - Asshole, get out of here."
1107,"00:47:59,625","00:48:01,461",What kind of hooker takes credit cards?
1108,"00:48:01,544","00:48:02,587",A rich one.
1109,"00:48:02,670","00:48:05,006","<i>At Stratton, there were three kinds of hookers.</i>"
1110,"00:48:05,089","00:48:07,383","<i>The Blue Chips, top of the line, model material.</i>"
1111,"00:48:07,467","00:48:08,968",<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>
1112,"00:48:09,052","00:48:11,846","<i>and you had to wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>"
1113,"00:48:11,929","00:48:13,806","<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>"

1298,"00:55:47,885","00:55:50,846","Very British, you know. She's a classy lady."
1299,"00:55:50,930","00:55:52,264",That explains it then.
1300,"00:55:52,348","00:55:53,349",Explains what?
1301,"00:55:53,432","00:55:56,227","It explains you. I mean, you're a duchess, right?"
1302,"00:55:56,352","00:55:58,729",The Duchess of Bay Ridge.
1303,"00:56:01,440","00:56:02,858",Excuse me.
1304,"00:56:02,942","00:56:04,944","Could I get a straw, please?"
1305,"00:56:06,111","00:56:07,571",Thank you.
1306,"00:56:10,574","00:56:15,829",So I was a little surprised you asked Cristy for my number.
1307,"00:56:16,914","00:56:18,165",Why is that?
1308,"00:56:19,959","00:56:21,877",Aren't you married?
1309,"00:56:23,128","00:56:25,422","Well... Yeah, but what?"
1310,"00:56:25,506","00:56:27,591",Married people can't have friends?
1311,"00:56:29,468","00:56:31,262",We're gonna be friends?
1312,"00:56:32,471","00:56:35,558",Yeah. You don't want to be my friend?
1313,"00:56:39,603","00:56:41,730",We're not gonna be friends.
1314,"00:56:49,989","00:56:52,449",And at night I work on my designs.
1315,"00:56:52,825","00:56:55,244",I have an entire line of lingerie.
1316,"00:56:55,327","00:56:58,205","You know, camisoles, bustiers, panties."
1317,"00:56:59,290","00:57:01,625","<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>"
1318,"00:57:01,709","00:57:03,419","<i>Oh, my God!</i>"
1319,"00:57:13,679","00:57:16,390","<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way to get up to her apartment.</i>"
1320,"00:57:21,520","00:57:23,981",You wanna come up for some tea or something?
1321,"00:57:25,357","00:57:26,942",Tea? Yeah.
1322,"00:57:27,192","00:57:28,944",- Like hot tea? - Yeah.
1323,"00:57:29,028","00:57:30,321","Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah."
1324,"00:57:30,487","00:57:32,698","<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah, I wanted to come up for tea.</i>"
1325,"00:57:32,865","00:57:35,743","Like Darjeeling or rose hip, something nice like that?"
1326,"00:57:35,951","00:57:36,952",Sure.
1327,"00:57:37,036","00:57:38,370",This is Rocky.
1328,"00:57:38,454","00:57:40,664","Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky."
1329,"00:57:40,914","00:57:41,999","Hi, sweetheart."
1330,"00:57:42,291","00:57:43,375",Okay.
1331,"00:57:44,043","00:57:46,545",Why don't you light a fire or something and I'll be right out.
1332,"00:57:47,129","00:57:48,922","- Yeah. Fire, here? - Sure."
1333,"00:57:52,343","00:57:53,886",I like your painting here. It's...
1334,"00:58:00,643","00:58:03,646","<i>God, help me. How do I fuck this girl?</i>"
1335,"00:58:07,191","00:58:08,275",You all right?
1336,"00:58:08,359","00:58:10,694","Yeah, yeah. Just trying to light the fire here."
1337,"00:58:16,408","00:58:17,910","<i>That's it. That's it, you're leaving.</i>"
1338,"00:58:17,993","00:58:19,870",<i>Don't get involved. Go home to your wife.</i>
1339,"00:58:29,838","00:58:31,674","<i>As you can probably guess,</i>"
1340,"00:58:31,757","00:58:34,301",<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>
1341,"00:58:34,802","00:58:36,136",Jesus Lord!
1342,"00:58:38,972","00:58:40,599",<i>For 11 seconds.</i>
1343,"00:58:51,443","00:58:52,986",Did you just come?
1344,"00:58:53,112","00:58:55,030","Oh, yeah, I just came."
1345,"00:58:56,073","00:58:57,408",Did you? Did you come?
1346,"00:58:57,616","00:58:59,201",- No. - No?
1347,"00:58:59,284","00:59:00,369",Okay.
1348,"00:59:00,494","00:59:02,621",I'm still hard so just give me a sec.
1349,"00:59:03,664","00:59:05,124",Sure.
1350,"00:59:05,416","00:59:07,042","Come on, baby, come on."
1351,"00:59:09,670","00:59:11,755","Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
1352,"00:59:17,636","00:59:19,012","Oh, God!"
1353,"00:59:19,304","00:59:21,014","Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog."
1354,"00:59:21,223","00:59:22,516",You have a biscuit or something like that?
1355,"00:59:22,599","00:59:23,684",It's okay.
1356,"00:59:23,767","00:59:25,227","- Just keep going. - Rocky, go play."
1357,"00:59:25,310","00:59:27,187","Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go."
1358,"00:59:29,773","00:59:31,066",You're crazy.
1359,"00:59:31,150","00:59:32,401",<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>
1360,"00:59:32,484","00:59:34,820","<i>I mean, her pussy was like heroin to me.</i>"
1361,"00:59:34,903","00:59:37,656","<i>And it wasn't just about the sex, either.</i>"
1362,"00:59:37,740","00:59:39,742","<i>Naomi and I got along. I mean, we...</i>"
1363,"00:59:39,825","00:59:41,660",<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i>
1364,"00:59:46,999","00:59:48,625",<i>Choc-choc tram.</i>
1365,"00:59:48,917","00:59:50,002",Yeah.
1366,"00:59:57,176","01:00:00,888",I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.
1367,"01:00:06,894","01:00:10,189","Yeah, yeah. Let's toke it all on there, huh?"
1368,"01:00:12,024","01:00:13,400","Oh, shit!"
1369,"01:00:23,994","01:00:25,162",You!
1370,"01:00:25,245","01:00:27,289",Get out of the fucking car!
1371,"01:00:27,664","01:00:28,707",Jesus Christ.
1372,"01:00:28,791","01:00:31,376","Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!"
1373,"01:00:32,628","01:00:34,463","Relax, sweetheart. Relax."
1374,"01:00:35,047","01:00:37,257","- Son of a fucking bitch! - Okay, okay... Geez!"
1375,"01:00:37,341","01:00:38,634","Okay, babe, stop!"
1376,"01:00:38,717","01:00:39,843",Please.
1377,"01:00:39,927","01:00:41,011",Bitch!
1378,"01:00:41,762","01:00:43,388",- What are you doing... - That whore from the party?
1379,"01:00:43,472","01:00:44,973",Jesus Christ!
1380,"01:00:45,057","01:00:46,141",What the fuck is wrong with you?
1381,"01:00:46,225","01:00:47,476",I thought you were at the fucking beach!
1382,"01:00:47,559","01:00:48,894",I didn't know you were here!
1383,"01:00:48,977","01:00:50,521",That's where you've fucking been?
1384,"01:00:50,604","01:00:52,314",With that fucking whore from the party?
1385,"01:00:52,397","01:00:53,816",I thought you were at the beach house.
1386,"01:00:53,899","01:00:55,275",How could you do this to me?
1387,"01:00:55,359","01:00:58,153","- Sweetie, come on... - Who the fuck are you, Jordan?"
1388,"01:00:58,237","01:01:00,989",You're like a completely different fucking person!
1389,"01:01:01,073","01:01:04,201","I made a mistake. I don't know what to tell you, babe. I..."
1390,"01:01:04,701","01:01:05,911",I'm sorry.
1391,"01:01:06,328","01:01:08,872",- I'm sorry. - Is that who... Is that what you want?
1392,"01:01:18,882","01:01:20,425",Do you love her?
1393,"01:01:26,098","01:01:27,558",Answer me.
1394,"01:01:49,162","01:01:51,206",<i>I felt horrible.</i>
1395,"01:01:52,082","01:01:54,042","<i>Three days later, I filed for a divorce</i>"
1396,"01:01:54,126","01:01:55,878",<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i>
1397,"01:02:00,465","01:02:03,886","<i>Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style.</i>"
1398,"01:02:03,969","01:02:07,097","<i>She brought in a decorator, feng shui'd the whole place.</i>"
1399,"01:02:07,180","01:02:09,558",<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>
1400,"01:02:09,641","01:02:12,227","<i>This guy was smart, sophisticated, professional.</i>"
1401,"01:02:12,311","01:02:13,896","<i>Really, really great.</i>"
1402,"01:02:14,146","01:02:15,314",Is that jasmine?
1403,"01:02:15,689","01:02:18,317","Yes, sir. I tried to stump you this evening. Very good."
1404,"01:02:18,650","01:02:20,277",Very good. Great nose.
1405,"01:02:20,360","01:02:22,029",<i>Except for that one time.</i>
1406,"01:02:27,451","01:02:28,702","Oh, my God!"
1407,"01:02:30,329","01:02:31,663","Oh, hey."
1408,"01:02:32,080","01:02:33,415",Is it Wednesday already?
1409,"01:02:34,374","01:02:35,626","Oh, don't stop."
1410,"01:02:35,709","01:02:36,793",What the fuck!
1411,"01:02:37,252","01:02:39,004",That is fucked up!
1412,"01:02:39,463","01:02:40,672",He must have thought we were still
1413,"01:02:40,756","01:02:42,341","at the Hamptons this weekend, you know."
1414,"01:02:42,424","01:02:43,800","Where were they doing it, sweetheart? In the bedroom?"
1415,"01:02:43,884","01:02:46,553",They were everywhere. There were two guys over there on the table.
1416,"01:02:46,637","01:02:47,888",There were more over here.
1417,"01:02:47,971","01:02:49,431",There were four right here.
1418,"01:02:49,514","01:02:51,183",Are you fucking serious? Right there?
1419,"01:02:51,266","01:02:54,102","- Why didn't you tell me? - Oh, baby, it gets worse."
1420,"01:02:55,604","01:02:58,148","After they left, I checked the apartment."
1421,"01:02:58,273","01:02:59,358",Right. What?
1422,"01:02:59,691","01:03:01,526","What is it, babe? What?"
1423,"01:03:01,860","01:03:02,945",<i>Where's my money?</i>
1424,"01:03:03,028","01:03:04,029",I don't know where your money...
1425,"01:03:04,112","01:03:06,114",Where is my fucking money? Where is it?
1426,"01:03:06,198","01:03:08,158","I don't know where your money is, Mr. Belfort."
1427,"01:03:08,241","01:03:10,494",- I didn't do anything. - If you don't get...
1428,"01:03:10,577","01:03:11,870",He's lying through his fucking teeth.
1429,"01:03:11,954","01:03:13,121",Let's start from the beginning.
1430,"01:03:13,205","01:03:14,456","Let's start from the beginning, all right?"
1431,"01:03:14,539","01:03:16,083","You invited some friends over, right?"
1432,"01:03:16,375","01:03:18,043",One thing led to another. Things got out of hand.
1433,"01:03:18,126","01:03:19,628","We understand that, we do."
1434,"01:03:19,711","01:03:22,130",We do blow all the time. We're fucking degenerates ourselves.
1435,"01:03:22,214","01:03:23,298","Look at us, right?"
1436,"01:03:23,382","01:03:24,967",But money was stolen from my apartment.
1437,"01:03:25,050","01:03:26,635",Right from my sock drawer. All right?
1438,"01:03:26,718","01:03:28,804","Like I said, I don't know where your money is."
1439,"01:03:28,887","01:03:30,263",Just start from the beginning. Who came over?
1440,"01:03:30,347","01:03:31,390",It was just a normal day.
1441,"01:03:31,473","01:03:32,808",I knew you were coming home the next day.
1442,"01:03:32,891","01:03:35,143",So everything would be fine. It'd be cleaned up.
1443,"01:03:35,227","01:03:37,145",I got a little high at breakfast.
1444,"01:03:37,229","01:03:39,022","So I got a little happy. I had some eggs,"
1445,"01:03:39,106","01:03:40,107",I had a little bit of ice cream.
1446,"01:03:40,190","01:03:42,025","And then I said, ""Who do I know that likes ice cream?"""
1447,"01:03:42,109","01:03:43,568","It's my friend, Rudy. So I called Rudy."
1448,"01:03:43,652","01:03:46,113","- Who's Rudy? - Yeah, who's Rudy?"
1449,"01:03:47,656","01:03:50,993",- You know who Rudy is. Come on. - Me? I don't...
1450,"01:03:51,076","01:03:52,202",- You know... - Who the fuck is Rudy?
1451,"01:03:52,285","01:03:53,328",I don't know anyone named Rudy.
1452,"01:03:53,412","01:03:54,496",Last month. The Lollipop Club.
1453,"01:03:54,579","01:03:56,039",You know who Rudy was. Dancing...
1454,"01:03:56,123","01:03:57,541",You know who Rudy is?
1455,"01:03:59,251","01:04:00,627",I don't fucking know any...
1456,"01:04:00,711","01:04:01,670",What do you mean?
1457,"01:04:01,753","01:04:02,838",So he went to The Lollipop Club?
1458,"01:04:02,921","01:04:04,506","Oh, he was at The Lollipop Club for sure."
1459,"01:04:04,589","01:04:06,174","On the stage, grinding with everybody."
1460,"01:04:06,258","01:04:08,260",I got fucked up. I like to dance.
1461,"01:04:08,385","01:04:09,886","I don't know. Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't."
1462,"01:04:09,970","01:04:11,596",I meet a lot of fucking people.
1463,"01:04:11,805","01:04:13,348","- What are you saying? - $50,000 was stolen"
1464,"01:04:13,432","01:04:14,641",from my fucking sock drawer!
1465,"01:04:14,725","01:04:16,226",All my girlfriend's jewelry is gone.
1466,"01:04:16,309","01:04:18,228",- Where the fuck is it? - Rudy. What the fuck?
1467,"01:04:18,311","01:04:20,355",Did your fucking little faggot friend Rudy take my shit?
1468,"01:04:20,439","01:04:22,107",Did he? Answer me!
1469,"01:04:22,441","01:04:24,693",Okay. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm...
1470,"01:04:24,901","01:04:25,986",This is a gay thing.
1471,"01:04:26,194","01:04:27,654","See, all of you..."
1472,"01:04:27,988","01:04:29,281",You think this is 'cause you're a fag?
1473,"01:04:30,073","01:04:31,408",My cousin's a fucking faggot.
1474,"01:04:31,491","01:04:33,869",And I go on vacation with him and his boyfriend. I love fags.
1475,"01:04:33,952","01:04:35,078","You were in charge, right?"
1476,"01:04:35,162","01:04:36,872",I will not be stolen from. You get that?
1477,"01:04:36,955","01:04:39,124",I fucking like gay people. I don't like you.
1478,"01:04:39,207","01:04:41,835",He should've hired a fucking Mexican like I have in my fucking house.
1479,"01:04:43,587","01:04:45,047",Shit! What the fuck...
1480,"01:04:49,301","01:04:50,635","Talk, you fuck, talk!"

1859,"01:23:13,654","01:23:16,657",I have been a rich man and I have been a poor man.
1860,"01:23:16,740","01:23:19,160",And I choose rich every fucking time.
1861,"01:23:20,411","01:23:23,080","Because at least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems,"
1862,"01:23:23,164","01:23:27,001","I show up in the back of a limo, wearing a $2,000 suit"

1878,"01:24:17,801","01:24:21,096","Some disgusting wildebeest with three days of razor-stubble,"
1879,"01:24:21,180","01:24:22,514","in a sleeveless muumuu,"
1880,"01:24:22,598","01:24:24,975",crammed in next to you in a carload full of groceries

1960,"01:28:11,743","01:28:14,955","you could go to his house, right?"
1961,"01:28:15,038","01:28:16,915","Tap his phones a little bit, bug him."
1962,"01:28:16,999","01:28:18,125",You could get some information...

1966,"01:28:23,505","01:28:25,132",This is what you fucking do. What do I pay you for?
1967,"01:28:25,215","01:28:28,302","I have a fucking P.I. license, you know? I make a living at this."
1968,"01:28:28,385","01:28:29,470",I'm not a cop anymore.
1969,"01:28:29,553","01:28:31,555","They'll take my fucking license away from me, all right?"
1970,"01:28:31,638","01:28:32,723",Okay.
1971,"01:28:33,432","01:28:35,684","Okay, if I can't do that, can I just..."
1972,"01:28:35,976","01:28:37,227",Can I give the guy a call?
1973,"01:28:38,437","01:28:40,439",- Why? Is that... - Jordan. Jordan.

1975,"01:28:41,607","01:28:44,526",The only one who calls this guy is your fucking lawyer.
1976,"01:28:44,610","01:28:45,611","I can't call him, right?"
1977,"01:28:45,694","01:28:47,446","- It's against the rules? - I told you,"

1979,"01:28:49,281","01:28:51,909",he's gonna use against you. Don't you understand?
1980,"01:28:51,992","01:28:53,744","He's smart, you're dumb."
1981,"01:28:53,827","01:28:55,078",Fucking bullshit.
1982,"01:28:55,662","01:28:58,165","Are we fucking talking tonight, or are you gonna get schwacked?"
1983,"01:28:58,248","01:28:59,791","The last time you took these fucking pills,"
1984,"01:28:59,917","01:29:01,877",you put your head in the fucking macaroni. I had to pick it up.
1985,"01:29:02,961","01:29:04,421",All right.
1986,"01:29:04,505","01:29:06,048","Okay, I won't call him."
1987,"01:29:08,967","01:29:12,888","Hey, fellas! Come on board. The plank's right around there."
1988,"01:29:13,764","01:29:15,140",Welcome!

1993,"01:29:25,484","01:29:27,069",Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

1995,"01:29:28,278","01:29:31,532","Let me introduce you. This is Nicole, Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy."
1996,"01:29:31,615","01:29:34,117",What are you guys all shy for? Don't be scared.
1997,"01:29:34,201","01:29:35,369",These are friends of Stratton.
1998,"01:29:35,452","01:29:36,954",- It's a pleasure. - Hello.
1999,"01:29:39,623","01:29:43,085",Your message said that you wanted to speak privately.
2000,"01:29:43,293","01:29:44,962",Right. I do want to speak privately.
2001,"01:29:45,128","01:29:46,380","Give us a minute, huh, ladies?"
2002,"01:29:46,463","01:29:48,048",Let me know if I can get you anything.
2003,"01:29:48,131","01:29:49,967",We'd be happy to help.
2004,"01:29:50,175","01:29:51,218",You guys hungry?
2005,"01:29:51,301","01:29:54,096","Want something to eat? Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster."
2006,"01:29:54,179","01:29:56,557",I got whiskey. Any kind of booze you want.
2007,"01:29:56,640","01:29:58,100",You know what? The Bureau doesn't allow us
2008,"01:29:58,183","01:29:59,601",to drink while we're at sea.
2009,"01:29:59,768","01:30:02,229",Duh! Of course.
2010,"01:30:02,312","01:30:04,147",Ever been on one of these before?
2011,"01:30:04,314","01:30:05,566",A boat?
2012,"01:30:06,316","01:30:07,609",I learned how to sail when I was six.
2013,"01:30:07,693","01:30:09,778",No shit. Is that right? Really?
2014,"01:30:09,861","01:30:11,572","On one like this, though?"
2015,"01:30:11,655","01:30:14,449",I had the whole front extended in order to fit the chopper up there.
2016,"01:30:14,575","01:30:15,867",See that?
2017,"01:30:17,160","01:30:18,620","Anyway, this is for you."
2018,"01:30:18,704","01:30:21,540",It's a complete list of every person that was at my wedding.
2019,"01:30:21,623","01:30:24,376",I understand you wanted the whole wedding video.
2020,"01:30:24,459","01:30:27,212","Figured this would help expedite the whole process, right?"
2021,"01:30:27,296","01:30:29,047","- There you go. - Look,"
2022,"01:30:29,131","01:30:32,050",my point is that I know you're investigating Stratton.
2023,"01:30:32,134","01:30:35,637","But for the life of me, I can't figure out why."
2024,"01:30:36,013","01:30:37,389","I know we're a little unorthodox,"
2025,"01:30:37,472","01:30:39,182",we're a little loud in the way we do things.
2026,"01:30:39,266","01:30:40,392","But you gotta understand,"
2027,"01:30:40,475","01:30:41,935","we're the new guys on the block, you know,"
2028,"01:30:42,019","01:30:44,146",we're trying to make a name for ourselves.
2029,"01:30:44,229","01:30:48,859","But I want you to understand, we don't do anything illegal."
2030,"01:30:49,651","01:30:50,736",Whatsoever.
2031,"01:30:50,819","01:30:52,362","I mean, you could talk to the SEC."
2032,"01:30:52,446","01:30:55,490",They were at my office 15 times over the last six months.
2033,"01:30:55,574","01:30:58,201","I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide."
2034,"01:30:58,285","01:31:01,038","Well, you know the SEC is a civil regulatory agency."
2035,"01:31:01,121","01:31:02,664",We pursue criminal activities.
2036,"01:31:02,748","01:31:05,584","Exactly! You go after real criminals,"
2037,"01:31:06,168","01:31:09,212",which makes me wonder what the hell you're investigating me for?
2038,"01:31:09,338","01:31:10,672","I mean, honestly..."
2039,"01:31:10,756","01:31:14,593",What is it that you think that we did or do? I don't get it.
2040,"01:31:14,718","01:31:15,969","Well, I..."
2041,"01:31:16,053","01:31:18,472","Look, Jordan, I can't discuss an ongoing investigation."
2042,"01:31:18,555","01:31:20,223","No, I get that. No, I understand."
2043,"01:31:20,349","01:31:21,725",With that said...
2044,"01:31:22,601","01:31:24,436",This case got dumped on my desk...
2045,"01:31:24,519","01:31:26,355","- Did it? - You know, by a higher-up"
2046,"01:31:26,438","01:31:29,650","who needs to make a show of looking into the new company on the block,"
2047,"01:31:29,733","01:31:31,193",- with all the press and everything. - New loud guys.
2048,"01:31:31,318","01:31:34,863",And then I end up being the schmuck who does the looking. Exactly.
2049,"01:31:34,946","01:31:36,865","It's just, you know... It bothers me."
2050,"01:31:36,948","01:31:39,493",We're the new guy. We're the one that's banging on Wall Street's door.
2051,"01:31:39,576","01:31:40,661","I mean, you should..."
2052,"01:31:40,744","01:31:42,663",You should see what's going on at the bigger firms.
2053,"01:31:42,746","01:31:44,206","I mean, I know all the information."
2054,"01:31:44,373","01:31:47,167","It's true! Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill..."
2055,"01:31:47,250","01:31:49,252",Collateralized debt obligations?
2056,"01:31:49,378","01:31:50,629",This Internet stock bullshit?
2057,"01:31:50,712","01:31:52,506","I mean, it's a fucking travesty."
2058,"01:31:52,589","01:31:57,594",I could take you step-by-step through what exactly is occurring.
2059,"01:31:57,844","01:31:59,429",All you have to do is ask.
2060,"01:31:59,596","01:32:00,889",I'm available.
2061,"01:32:01,056","01:32:02,432",That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
2062,"01:32:02,516","01:32:05,394",I don't see why a little sit-down like this
2063,"01:32:06,269","01:32:07,813",can't be profitable for the both of us.
2064,"01:32:07,938","01:32:10,190",It should. Right? It should profit the both of us.
2065,"01:32:10,273","01:32:11,775",- It should. - Look.
2066,"01:32:12,317","01:32:14,528",I'm gonna give you my personal line.
2067,"01:32:14,611","01:32:17,531","Five days a week, you just call me, feel free."
2068,"01:32:17,739","01:32:19,449",- I'll do that. - Great.
2069,"01:32:22,035","01:32:23,704",Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?
2070,"01:32:23,787","01:32:25,455",You're not hungry? Nothing?
2071,"01:32:25,539","01:32:27,165","- Nothing? No? - Oh, no."
2072,"01:32:30,293","01:32:32,879","Let me ask you, and if you don't wanna get too personal,"
2073,"01:32:32,963","01:32:35,257",just tell me to shut up at any time.
2074,"01:32:36,133","01:32:38,760",Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?
2075,"01:32:38,844","01:32:41,680",Did I hear that right? Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?
2076,"01:32:42,597","01:32:44,516",- No? - Who you been talking to?
2077,"01:32:44,599","01:32:45,600",Who the fuck you been talking to?
2078,"01:32:45,684","01:32:48,437","Well, you're investigating me. I hear things."
2079,"01:32:48,520","01:32:50,605",You know what I mean?
2080,"01:32:50,689","01:32:52,274",You ever think about what would've happened
2081,"01:32:52,357","01:32:54,818",if you would have stayed the course?
2082,"01:32:56,236","01:32:58,071",You know what? When I'm riding home on the subway
2083,"01:32:58,155","01:32:59,406","and my balls are fucking sweating,"
2084,"01:32:59,489","01:33:01,283",I'm wearing the same suit three days in a row...
2085,"01:33:01,366","01:33:02,868","Yeah, you bet I do."
2086,"01:33:02,951","01:33:04,619","I've thought about it before. Who wouldn't, right?"
2087,"01:33:04,703","01:33:05,746","Right, who fucking wouldn't?"
2088,"01:33:05,829","01:33:06,997",What do you get...
2089,"01:33:07,080","01:33:08,331","Another personal question, no need to answer..."
2090,"01:33:08,415","01:33:09,791","No, that's all right, Jordan."
2091,"01:33:09,875","01:33:12,919","What do you pull in? 50, 60K? Something like that?"
2092,"01:33:13,044","01:33:15,046",A year? In the ballpark?
2093,"01:33:15,130","01:33:16,590","Well, I..."
2094,"01:33:16,673","01:33:18,467",Let's put it this way.
2095,"01:33:18,550","01:33:21,344",You get a free handgun when you sign up for the Bureau.
2096,"01:33:22,095","01:33:24,222","No, but it fucking pisses me off. You know what I mean?"
2097,"01:33:24,306","01:33:26,475","You think about the people that built this country,"
2098,"01:33:26,558","01:33:27,976",hardworking people like you.
2099,"01:33:28,059","01:33:30,604","Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents."
2100,"01:33:30,729","01:33:34,399","End of the day, you guys get fucking skinned alive financially."
2101,"01:33:34,483","01:33:36,359",It fucking makes me angry.
2102,"01:33:36,443","01:33:39,529","Now the one thing about Wall Street and this market is,"
2103,"01:33:39,613","01:33:41,281","for me, I feel"
2104,"01:33:42,365","01:33:44,701","it's good to give back. You know, there's..."
2105,"01:33:44,785","01:33:46,953",There are situations where I can
2106,"01:33:47,037","01:33:50,582",make those situations better for people. You know?
2107,"01:33:50,665","01:33:51,958",You know what I mean.
2108,"01:33:52,042","01:33:53,460",Opportunity...
2109,"01:33:53,752","01:33:55,003",is everything.
2110,"01:33:55,080","01:33:56,332",Exactly.
2111,"01:33:56,457","01:33:58,918","Take for example, I got this one kid, right?"
2112,"01:33:59,001","01:34:02,797","Went to school for environmental science, something like that."
2113,"01:34:02,880","01:34:04,673",He was bogged down by student loans.
2114,"01:34:04,757","01:34:07,468","Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery."
2115,"01:34:07,551","01:34:08,969",- Jesus. - Right. Horrible situation.
2116,"01:34:09,053","01:34:10,012",Sure.
2117,"01:34:10,095","01:34:11,180",But we got him into the market
2118,"01:34:11,263","01:34:12,973",at the right time and chose the right stock.
2119,"01:34:13,057","01:34:14,809",We gave him the right guidance.
2120,"01:34:14,892","01:34:18,062","Boom! Overnight, changed his entire life."
2121,"01:34:18,187","01:34:21,524",Got to put his mother into the best hospital in New York City.
2122,"01:34:21,607","01:34:24,485","It didn't work out for her, granted, she passed away, unfortunately."
2123,"01:34:24,568","01:34:26,487",But we gave him that opportunity.
2124,"01:34:26,570","01:34:27,738",You know what I'm saying?
2125,"01:34:28,447","01:34:32,952","It's just about setting up the right team, and then overnight your life can change."
2126,"01:34:38,332","01:34:40,751",What does... What does an intern...
2127,"01:34:42,294","01:34:44,171",What does an intern make in a deal like that?
2128,"01:34:44,255","01:34:46,298","Well, in that situation,"
2129,"01:34:47,216","01:34:50,261","in that particular trade, and it was one trade,"
2130,"01:34:50,594","01:34:53,097",north of half a million dollars.
2131,"01:34:56,725","01:34:58,978","And I'd do that for anybody, you know,"
2132,"01:34:59,061","01:35:01,730",anybody that needs the proper guidance.
2133,"01:35:21,542","01:35:25,629","Can you say that again, just the way you said it?"
2134,"01:35:26,046","01:35:27,756",Just the same way.
2135,"01:35:31,969","01:35:33,053",I don't know what you're talking about.
2136,"01:35:33,137","01:35:35,389","Oh, come on! You know what I'm talking about."
2137,"01:35:35,472","01:35:37,474",I think what Jordan just did is he...
2138,"01:35:37,558","01:35:38,684",- If I'm not mistaken... - No.
2139,"01:35:38,767","01:35:40,895",You just tried to bribe a federal officer.
2140,"01:35:40,978","01:35:43,063","No, technically I didn't bribe anybody."
2141,"01:35:43,147","01:35:45,566","No, no, that's not the conversation I heard, Jordan."
2142,"01:35:45,649","01:35:47,151","No, no, according to the U.S. criminal code,"
2143,"01:35:47,234","01:35:50,654",there needs to be an exact dollar figure for the exchange of services.
2144,"01:35:50,738","01:35:52,364",That would not hold up in a court of law.
2145,"01:35:52,448","01:35:54,116","Nah, it's not how I heard it."
2146,"01:35:54,199","01:35:56,911","No, no, no, that's the truth. But I want to tell you this."
2147,"01:35:56,994","01:35:57,995",Yeah.
2148,"01:35:58,078","01:35:59,580",The same gentleman that told me
2149,"01:35:59,663","01:36:01,415",that you tried to get your broker's license
2150,"01:36:01,498","01:36:03,626",also told me that you are a straight arrow.
2151,"01:36:03,751","01:36:05,210",He ran a security check on me.
2152,"01:36:05,294","01:36:06,503",Well...
2153,"01:36:06,629","01:36:09,590","Yeah, when you sail on a boat fit for a Bond villain,"
2154,"01:36:09,673","01:36:12,343",sometimes you need to play the part. Right?
2155,"01:36:13,135","01:36:15,054",I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat.
2156,"01:36:15,179","01:36:16,430",What do you say?
2157,"01:36:17,514","01:36:18,766","You know, Jordan, I'll tell you something."
2158,"01:36:18,849","01:36:21,852","Most of the Wall Street jackasses that I bust,"
2159,"01:36:22,269","01:36:24,605",they're to the manor born.
2160,"01:36:24,688","01:36:25,773",- Is that right? - Yeah.
2161,"01:36:25,856","01:36:29,485","Their fathers are douchebags, just like their fathers before them."
2162,"01:36:30,611","01:36:32,029",But you...
2163,"01:36:33,739","01:36:36,033","You, Jordan, you got this way all on your own."
2164,"01:36:36,200","01:36:37,368",Did I?
2165,"01:36:37,451","01:36:39,536","- Good for you, little man. - Little man?"
2166,"01:36:39,662","01:36:40,913",Good for you.
2167,"01:36:41,038","01:36:42,164","Me, the little man?"
2168,"01:36:42,247","01:36:43,290",And let me tell you something.
2169,"01:36:43,374","01:36:45,209",Let me tell you something else.
2170,"01:36:45,334","01:36:47,503","Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,"
2171,"01:36:47,670","01:36:48,796",this is one of the nicest boats
2172,"01:36:48,879","01:36:50,881","that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you. - I bet it is."
2173,"01:36:50,965","01:36:52,383","And you know what I was just thinking, too?"
2174,"01:36:52,508","01:36:55,761",The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office
2175,"01:36:55,886","01:36:58,055",when the Bureau seizes this fucking boat.
2176,"01:36:58,180","01:37:00,349","Because, I mean, fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,"
2177,"01:37:00,432","01:37:01,725",look at this thing!
2178,"01:37:02,101","01:37:03,143",It's beautiful!
2179,"01:37:03,227","01:37:06,188",And you got the beautiful girls there. It's wonderful.
2180,"01:37:06,271","01:37:08,732","All right, get the fuck off my boat."
2181,"01:37:08,899","01:37:10,442",I'm sure we'll be seeing each other...
2182,"01:37:10,526","01:37:11,568",real soon. - I'm sure.
2183,"01:37:11,652","01:37:15,114","Good luck on that subway ride home to your miserable, ugly fucking wives."
2184,"01:37:15,197","01:37:18,283",I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off my balls in the meantime.
2185,"01:37:18,409","01:37:21,036","Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters for your ride home?"
2186,"01:37:21,120","01:37:23,747","Fucking miserable pricks, I know you can't afford them!"
2187,"01:37:23,831","01:37:25,916",Fucking cheap fucks.
2188,"01:37:26,083","01:37:28,043",Fucking miserable pricks.
2189,"01:37:28,127","01:37:31,338","Hey, fellas! Look what I found in my pocket! Look!"
2190,"01:37:31,630","01:37:33,382",A year's salary right here.
2191,"01:37:33,465","01:37:36,135",You know what I call them? Fun coupons!
2192,"01:37:36,218","01:37:37,469",See that!
2193,"01:37:38,012","01:37:40,014",They're fun coupons!
2194,"01:37:47,813","01:37:50,566",Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland?
2195,"01:37:50,691","01:37:52,693","<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i>"
2196,"01:37:52,776","01:37:55,446",<i>It was ass-covering time. I had to hide my money.</i>
2197,"01:37:56,739","01:37:58,282",<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>
2198,"01:37:58,407","01:38:00,034",<i>He knew this Swiss banker from law school.</i>
2199,"01:38:00,117","01:38:01,160",That's for European pussy!
2200,"01:38:01,243","01:38:02,494",<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>
2201,"01:38:02,578","01:38:04,955",<i>And there was no way I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>
2202,"01:38:06,790","01:38:08,417","<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i>"
2203,"01:38:08,500","01:38:10,544",<i>I could sleep through the entire flight.</i>
2204,"01:38:10,961","01:38:13,297",<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>
2205,"01:38:13,922","01:38:15,966","<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped a few more ludes,</i>"
2206,"01:38:16,050","01:38:17,509",<i>which started kicking in by the time</i>
2207,"01:38:17,593","01:38:19,344",<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>
2208,"01:38:19,595","01:38:20,804",<i>My tingle phase.</i>
2209,"01:38:21,138","01:38:22,806","<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>"
2210,"01:38:22,890","01:38:25,809",<i>on top of some cocktails and a Valium or two.</i>
2211,"01:38:25,976","01:38:27,478",<i>My slur phase.</i>
2212,"01:38:29,646","01:38:31,982","<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i>"
2213,"01:38:32,191","01:38:34,777",<i>and pretty much lost all my motor skills.</i>

2341,"01:43:53,887","01:43:58,433",But there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices.

2777,"02:05:34,019","02:05:35,270","Oh, shit!"
2778,"02:05:35,354","02:05:37,231","Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?"

2781,"02:05:40,484","02:05:41,819","Jordan, he's not breathing."
2782,"02:05:41,902","02:05:43,696","Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do."
2783,"02:05:43,779","02:05:45,030","Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!"
2784,"02:05:45,114","02:05:46,448","I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan."
2785,"02:05:48,492","02:05:51,036","Oh, my God, I think he's choking, Jordan. Do something."
2786,"02:05:51,120","02:05:52,871","- Oh, God. - Baby, I got you!"
2787,"02:05:53,455","02:05:56,333","He's not breathing, Jordan. You gotta do something!"
2788,"02:05:57,251","02:05:59,545","Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"

2804,"02:07:13,952","02:07:16,288",You all right? He's all right.
2805,"02:07:29,468","02:07:31,553",Mr. Belfort?
2806,"02:07:32,513","02:07:33,972",Mr. Belfort?
2807,"02:07:36,642","02:07:39,561",Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.
2808,"02:07:39,645","02:07:42,147","Sir, we need to ask you some questions."
2809,"02:07:42,815","02:07:44,775",Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.
2810,"02:07:44,858","02:07:45,984","Come on, get up."
2811,"02:07:46,068","02:07:47,611",Get the fuck out of my house.
2812,"02:07:49,404","02:07:51,114",- Let's go. - I've been here all night.
2813,"02:07:51,198","02:07:52,699",I been sitting here all night.
2814,"02:07:52,783","02:07:54,159",What the fuck are you talking about?
2815,"02:07:54,243","02:07:56,203",- Where you taking him? - Where you taking me?
2816,"02:07:56,286","02:07:57,371",Where you taking him?
2817,"02:07:57,454","02:07:58,497",You ain't got no warrant.
2818,"02:07:58,580","02:07:59,873",Just come up in people's house like that!
2819,"02:08:01,041","02:08:03,335","Did you drive your car tonight, Mr. Belfort?"
2820,"02:08:04,920","02:08:05,963",Well?
2821,"02:08:09,258","02:08:10,634",<i>Wow!</i>
2822,"02:08:10,926","02:08:12,719",<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i>
2823,"02:08:27,860","02:08:30,237",Get out of the fucking way!
2824,"02:08:32,197","02:08:33,448",Fuck!
2825,"02:08:39,079","02:08:42,708",Did you drive that car tonight?
2826,"02:08:43,834","02:08:45,961","- Yeah. - Yeah, right."
2827,"02:08:46,044","02:08:47,838",I'm a family man!
2828,"02:08:47,921","02:08:49,673",Family man. Honey!
2829,"02:08:49,756","02:08:51,717","<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i>"
2830,"02:08:51,800","02:08:54,803",<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i>
2831,"02:08:54,887","02:08:58,056","<i>The cops took me in for questioning, but they couldn't charge me.</i>"
2832,"02:08:58,140","02:09:00,559",<i>They had no proof I was even behind the wheel.</i>
2833,"02:09:00,642","02:09:01,727","<i>Meanwhile,</i>"
2834,"02:09:01,810","02:09:03,896",<i>Brad did three months in jail for contempt</i>
2835,"02:09:03,979","02:09:06,565",<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i>
2836,"02:09:06,648","02:09:09,359","<i>The result, I was scat-free.</i>"
2837,"02:09:09,443","02:09:11,820",<i>But I had eyes on me like never before.</i>
2838,"02:09:11,904","02:09:13,572","You're a lucky man, Jordan."
2839,"02:09:13,655","02:09:16,575","You're lucky to be alive, let alone not in jail."
2840,"02:09:16,658","02:09:18,243","You know I don't believe in luck, right?"
2841,"02:09:18,327","02:09:19,661",But it's time.
2842,"02:09:19,745","02:09:21,997","Please, let me call the SEC and cut a deal"
2843,"02:09:22,080","02:09:23,999",before your luck runs out.
2844,"02:09:24,082","02:09:25,667",Wave to Daddy.
2845,"02:09:25,751","02:09:26,835",Hey.
2846,"02:09:26,919","02:09:28,420","Hey, sweetie."
2847,"02:09:33,634","02:09:36,929",What kind of terms would you be talking about if I...
2848,"02:09:37,012","02:09:38,221",I don't know.
2849,"02:09:38,305","02:09:41,266","You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations,"
2850,"02:09:41,350","02:09:44,394","stock manipulation, high-pressure sales tactics."
2851,"02:09:44,478","02:09:47,272","Ticky-tack shit like that, you know."
2852,"02:09:47,356","02:09:49,316","You pay a couple million dollars in fines,"
2853,"02:09:49,399","02:09:52,361","in exchange, the SEC fucks off till the end of time."
2854,"02:09:54,696","02:09:56,323",And Stratton?
2855,"02:09:56,823","02:09:58,700",What happens to Stratton?
2856,"02:09:58,784","02:10:01,620",There's no way... I mean... You got to walk away. Right?
2857,"02:10:01,703","02:10:02,829",Let Donnie be in charge.
2858,"02:10:02,913","02:10:04,539",Right. Donnie.
2859,"02:10:05,248","02:10:07,417",Now the FBI is another animal completely.
2860,"02:10:07,501","02:10:09,294",They'll still be pursuing you for criminal wrongdoing.
2861,"02:10:09,378","02:10:12,130","However, with you stepping down voluntarily,"
2862,"02:10:12,214","02:10:14,132",my guess is that your best friend Agent Denham
2863,"02:10:14,216","02:10:16,551",will be standing around with his dick in his hand.
2864,"02:10:17,678","02:10:18,971",Jordan.
2865,"02:10:19,054","02:10:20,973",What do you have to think about?
2866,"02:10:21,056","02:10:22,641",You beat them.
2867,"02:10:22,724","02:10:23,850",You won!
2868,"02:10:23,934","02:10:25,560",God knows you never have to work again.
2869,"02:10:25,644","02:10:27,646",What're you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in jail?
2870,"02:10:27,729","02:10:28,814",- Is that what you want? - No.
2871,"02:10:28,897","02:10:29,940",- Of course not. - Okay.
2872,"02:10:30,023","02:10:32,067",Okay! You got all the money in the world.
2873,"02:10:32,150","02:10:33,735",You need everybody else's money?
2874,"02:10:33,819","02:10:35,237","- Of course not, Pops. - Well?"
2875,"02:10:35,320","02:10:37,656","- You know, I built it. - I know you built it."
2876,"02:10:37,739","02:10:39,449","You built it, so now preserve it."
2877,"02:11:10,689","02:11:12,107","You know,"
2878,"02:11:12,482","02:11:15,193","five years ago, when I started Stratton Oakmont"
2879,"02:11:15,277","02:11:17,362","with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day"
2880,"02:11:17,446","02:11:20,741",would eventually come where I'd have to be moving on.
2881,"02:11:22,701","02:11:26,496",And it's truly with a heavy heart that I'm here to say that...
2882,"02:11:28,123","02:11:30,292",That that day is finally here.
2883,"02:11:34,504","02:11:36,798",I wanna... I want to thank you all for your...
2884,"02:11:36,882","02:11:39,551",Your years of loyalty and admiration.
2885,"02:11:39,634","02:11:41,094",But the point is this.
2886,"02:11:42,054","02:11:43,305","Under Donnie's leadership,"
2887,"02:11:43,388","02:11:46,850",along with Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg
2888,"02:11:46,933","02:11:49,728","moving into key management positions, this place really"
2889,"02:11:49,811","02:11:51,146",is gonna be better than ever!
2890,"02:11:51,229","02:11:53,356",That I promise you. Okay?
2891,"02:11:53,732","02:11:56,234",Give them a round of applause. Come on.
2892,"02:11:59,321","02:12:02,074","This is Ellis Island here, people."
2893,"02:12:02,157","02:12:03,825","I don't care who you are, where you're from,"
2894,"02:12:03,909","02:12:06,411",whether your relatives came over on the fucking <i>Mayflower</i>
2895,"02:12:06,495","02:12:08,663","or on an inner tube from Haiti,"
2896,"02:12:08,747","02:12:10,999",this right here is the land of opportunity.
2897,"02:12:11,083","02:12:13,585",Stratton Oakmont is America!
2898,"02:12:17,631","02:12:19,257","All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?"
2899,"02:12:19,341","02:12:20,550","Yes, we do."
2900,"02:12:20,634","02:12:21,760",Fuck you.
2901,"02:12:22,427","02:12:23,637","Come on, Kimmie."
2902,"02:12:23,720","02:12:25,263","What you probably didn't know is,"
2903,"02:12:25,347","02:12:27,140","Kimmie was one of the first brokers here,"
2904,"02:12:27,224","02:12:29,518",one of Stratton's original 20.
2905,"02:12:30,268","02:12:32,104","Now most of you met Kimmie,"
2906,"02:12:32,187","02:12:35,190",the beautiful sophisticated woman that she is today.
2907,"02:12:35,607","02:12:38,693","A woman that wears $3,000 Armani suits."
2908,"02:12:40,695","02:12:43,240",Who drives a brand-new Mercedes Benz.
2909,"02:12:43,949","02:12:45,784",A woman who spends
2910,"02:12:45,867","02:12:47,285",her winters in the Bahamas
2911,"02:12:47,369","02:12:49,496",and summers in the Hamptons!
2912,"02:12:54,501","02:12:56,837",That's not the Kimmie that I met.
2913,"02:12:59,673","02:13:03,426",The Kimmie that I met didn't have two nickels to rub together.
2914,"02:13:04,678","02:13:06,930",She was a single mom on the balls of her ass
2915,"02:13:07,013","02:13:08,807",with an eight-year-old son.
2916,"02:13:08,890","02:13:11,893",Okay? She was three months behind on her rent.
2917,"02:13:12,978","02:13:16,648","And when she came to me and asked me for a job,"
2918,"02:13:16,731","02:13:18,942","she asked for a $5,000 advance"
2919,"02:13:19,025","02:13:22,195",just so she could pay her son's tuition.
2920,"02:13:26,658","02:13:28,368","And what'd I do, Kimmie?"
2921,"02:13:28,451","02:13:30,162","Go on, tell them."
2922,"02:13:31,913","02:13:33,957",You wrote me a check
2923,"02:13:34,207","02:13:36,293","for $25,000."
2924,"02:13:37,586","02:13:39,045",That's right.
2925,"02:13:39,171","02:13:40,505",Thank you.
2926,"02:13:43,925","02:13:45,677",And you know why that is?
2927,"02:13:49,014","02:13:51,308",It's because I believed in you.
2928,"02:13:53,018","02:13:55,729","It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,"
2929,"02:13:56,146","02:14:00,025",just like I believe in each and every one of you here today.
2930,"02:14:00,108","02:14:02,527","- I fucking love you, Jordan! - I fucking love you."
2931,"02:14:02,611","02:14:04,404",I fucking love you! I love you.
2932,"02:14:04,487","02:14:07,282","I fucking love you, too! I fucking love you, too!"
2933,"02:14:10,202","02:14:12,204",And I love all of you!
2934,"02:14:12,787","02:14:15,123",And I love all of you from the bottom of my heart.
2935,"02:14:15,207","02:14:17,667","- I fucking love you, too. - I mean that."
2936,"02:14:18,501","02:14:20,795",You are the shit. You are the fucking shit.
2937,"02:14:27,302","02:14:29,471","It's a shame, you know."
2938,"02:14:31,056","02:14:35,185","For years, I've been telling you guys never to take no for an answer, right?"
2939,"02:14:35,268","02:14:38,480","You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone"
2940,"02:14:39,397","02:14:41,650",until you get what you want.
2941,"02:14:42,525","02:14:44,277",Because you all deserve it.
2942,"02:14:46,321","02:14:49,491","You know, this fucking deal that I'm about to sign"
2943,"02:14:49,991","02:14:52,118","barring me from the securities industry,"
2944,"02:14:52,202","02:14:54,246","barring me from Stratton,"
2945,"02:14:55,330","02:14:56,748",my home.
2946,"02:14:59,501","02:15:01,503","What the fuck is that, you know?"
2947,"02:15:02,712","02:15:05,048",I'll tell you what it is. It's...
2948,"02:15:05,799","02:15:08,593","It's me taking no for an answer, you know."
2949,"02:15:10,095","02:15:11,346",It's them...
2950,"02:15:11,429","02:15:14,683","It's them selling me, not the other way around."
2951,"02:15:15,433","02:15:18,144",It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
2952,"02:15:23,316","02:15:24,567",So...
2953,"02:15:31,700","02:15:33,243",You know what?

3168,"02:24:54,595","02:24:56,931",I'll chop your fucking credit card in half. How about that?
3169,"02:24:57,014","02:24:58,891",Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3172,"02:25:03,938","02:25:05,106","Yeah, we're gonna take it slow."
3173,"02:25:05,189","02:25:06,774",It's a little uncomfortable. Tell them it's safe.
3174,"02:25:06,858","02:25:08,025",It's gonna be safe.
3175,"02:25:08,109","02:25:11,696",We'll batten down the hatches and secure the deck.

3329,"02:32:12,783","02:32:14,451",I hate that fucking dog.
3330,"02:32:14,535","02:32:16,870","Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit."
3331,"02:32:16,954","02:32:18,455",Starting to shit in the house again.
3332,"02:32:18,539","02:32:20,249","- Me, too. - Come here, buddy."
3333,"02:32:20,332","02:32:21,625","Ah, fuck."
3334,"02:32:21,709","02:32:23,335","- It's good to see you, pal. - Yeah, you, too."
3335,"02:32:23,419","02:32:24,628",Good to see you.
3336,"02:32:24,712","02:32:27,214","Sit down. Oh, man."
3337,"02:32:29,091","02:32:30,384","How you doing, brother?"
3338,"02:32:31,218","02:32:32,720",You know.
3339,"02:32:32,803","02:32:34,471","Shitty, pal."
3340,"02:32:34,555","02:32:36,682",But I'm hanging in there.
3341,"02:32:38,017","02:32:40,519",My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.
3342,"02:32:40,602","02:32:42,980","Can't leave the house, you know?"
3343,"02:32:43,063","02:32:45,649",Starting to get cabin fever already.
3344,"02:32:46,233","02:32:47,776",Fucking Rugrat.
3345,"02:32:48,360","02:32:49,653",That wig-wearing faggot.
3346,"02:32:49,737","02:32:51,864",I can't believe that fucking guy. I wanna kill him.
3347,"02:32:51,947","02:32:54,533","Swear to God, I want to choke him to death."
3348,"02:32:54,616","02:32:56,910",Irresponsible little prick.
3349,"02:32:57,036","02:32:58,078",I'll tell you one thing.
3350,"02:33:00,456","02:33:02,958",I'm never eating at Benihana again.
3351,"02:33:03,834","02:33:06,003",I don't care whose birthday it is.
3352,"02:33:07,421","02:33:08,964",Where's Naomi? How's she doing?
3353,"02:33:09,757","02:33:11,050",That's her in the house there.
3354,"02:33:11,133","02:33:13,093","You could say hi, but she probably won't wave back."
3355,"02:33:13,344","02:33:14,970","Naomi, sweetheart!"
3356,"02:33:18,432","02:33:19,683",What's up her ass?
3357,"02:33:19,767","02:33:21,310","- Is she mad at me? - No, you know..."
3358,"02:33:21,393","02:33:22,853",We probably have to mortgage the house
3359,"02:33:22,936","02:33:24,730",in order to make bail.
3360,"02:33:24,813","02:33:28,525",Probably end up selling the thing in order to pay for all the lawyers.
3361,"02:33:28,609","02:33:31,070","It's been a nightmare, buddy, to tell you the truth."
3362,"02:33:31,320","02:33:33,030","What are you gonna do, right?"
3363,"02:33:33,822","02:33:36,658","Anyway, how's Stratton? That's more important."
3364,"02:33:36,742","02:33:37,826",How's morale?
3365,"02:33:37,910","02:33:40,537",They all pissed off 'cause they have to make money legally now?
3366,"02:33:40,621","02:33:42,081",Jordan.
3367,"02:33:42,456","02:33:44,875",I got the founding partners together.
3368,"02:33:44,958","02:33:47,378",I talked to them about everything.
3369,"02:33:48,128","02:33:49,129",And I got you.
3370,"02:33:49,963","02:33:51,548","What do you mean, you got me?"
3371,"02:33:52,716","02:33:55,469","The house, money, don't worry about it. I got you."
3372,"02:34:01,475","02:34:02,559",All right.
3373,"02:34:02,643","02:34:03,602","I love you, buddy."
3374,"02:34:03,685","02:34:05,604","- You know I'd do it for you, right? - I know."
3375,"02:34:05,687","02:34:07,648","- You know that, right? - I know."
3376,"02:34:08,649","02:34:09,775",I could fucking kiss you all over.
3377,"02:34:09,858","02:34:11,026","All right, enough, enough."
3378,"02:34:13,112","02:34:14,238","You want a beer, pal?"
3379,"02:34:14,321","02:34:15,572",What are you drinking?
3380,"02:34:15,656","02:34:17,741",I got this non-alcoholic shit.
3381,"02:34:17,825","02:34:19,034",What's that?
3382,"02:34:19,118","02:34:22,121",A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.
3383,"02:34:22,204","02:34:24,498","- It's a beer? - Yeah, with no alcohol."
3384,"02:34:25,040","02:34:26,291","But if you drink enough,"
3385,"02:34:26,375","02:34:28,293","if you drink a lot, they get you fucked up?"
3386,"02:34:28,377","02:34:30,462","No, there's no alcohol. That's the fucking point."
3387,"02:34:30,546","02:34:31,588",I'm not a scientist.
3388,"02:34:31,672","02:34:32,840",I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
3389,"02:34:32,923","02:34:34,508",I can get you a beer if you want a fucking beer.
3390,"02:34:34,633","02:34:36,760","I know, but I don't drink. You remember?"
3391,"02:34:36,844","02:34:38,053",I don't drink anymore.
3392,"02:34:38,137","02:34:40,597","Oh, you wanna go inside and blow some lines of baking powder?"
3393,"02:34:40,681","02:34:41,849",Or baking soda...
3394,"02:34:42,641","02:34:44,935",Can't imagine ever not enjoying getting fucked up.
3395,"02:34:45,018","02:34:46,437",- Yeah. - I love it.
3396,"02:34:46,520","02:34:48,063",How's being sober?
3397,"02:34:48,147","02:34:49,982","- Fucking sucks. - Boring, right?"
3398,"02:34:50,065","02:34:52,484",So boring. I wanna kill myself.
3399,"02:34:53,026","02:34:55,571","There's a term, and we don't like to use it"
3400,"02:34:55,654","02:34:57,114","unless circumstances dictate,"
3401,"02:34:57,197","02:34:59,158","and I think they do dictate in this case,"
3402,"02:34:59,241","02:35:00,659","and the term is ""Grenada."""
3403,"02:35:00,742","02:35:02,286",Have you ever heard of Grenada?
3404,"02:35:02,369","02:35:03,412","No. No, I haven't."
3405,"02:35:03,537","02:35:07,040",Grenada's very interesting because it is a small island nation
3406,"02:35:07,124","02:35:10,669",that was invaded by the United States of America in 1983.
3407,"02:35:10,752","02:35:12,838","It's about 90,000 people."
3408,"02:35:12,921","02:35:15,174","And essentially, it means"
3409,"02:35:15,924","02:35:17,926",this case is unloseable.
3410,"02:35:18,010","02:35:19,094",Okay?
3411,"02:35:19,178","02:35:20,762","So, you know, we can come in,"
3412,"02:35:20,846","02:35:22,681",we can have our dick hanging out of our pants.
3413,"02:35:22,764","02:35:23,932",Nobody gives a fuck.
3414,"02:35:24,016","02:35:25,559",I'm gonna win.
3415,"02:35:25,726","02:35:27,102","You, sir,"
3416,"02:35:28,645","02:35:30,397",are what's known
3417,"02:35:31,398","02:35:32,608",as a Grenada.
3418,"02:35:35,736","02:35:38,071",You're looking at real prison time.
3419,"02:35:39,239","02:35:41,575",Money laundering can get you as much as 20 years.
3420,"02:35:42,576","02:35:45,245",And our case couldn't be stronger if we caught you
3421,"02:35:45,329","02:35:46,997",shoving cash in your mattress.
3422,"02:35:47,080","02:35:48,123",Is that right?
3423,"02:35:48,999","02:35:51,418","Hey, Jordan. Jordan."
3424,"02:35:52,127","02:35:55,964","Your rotting away in jail till your kids get out of college,"
3425,"02:35:56,048","02:35:57,674",that's not our ambition here.
3426,"02:35:59,092","02:36:01,637","There's other people involved in this, too."
3427,"02:36:01,720","02:36:04,848",We think they need to see their day in court as well.
3428,"02:36:07,434","02:36:09,478",Why do I sense there's an offer in the air?
3429,"02:36:09,561","02:36:12,231","Look at him. He's got a sense. What are you, Kreskin?"
3430,"02:36:13,440","02:36:16,193",Full cooperation. He provides us with a comprehensive list
3431,"02:36:16,276","02:36:18,654","of all the co-conspirators spanning the last seven years,"
3432,"02:36:18,737","02:36:20,697",and he also agrees to wear a wire.
3433,"02:36:20,781","02:36:22,032",Wait...
3434,"02:36:22,115","02:36:23,867","Did you just say ""wear a wire""?"
3435,"02:36:23,951","02:36:25,202",A wire.
3436,"02:36:25,285","02:36:26,662",What does that mean?
3437,"02:36:26,745","02:36:28,580",You want me to rat? Is that it?
3438,"02:36:28,664","02:36:29,957","No, I want you to cooperate."
3439,"02:36:30,040","02:36:31,959","- No. You want me to rat, right? - Yes. We want you to rat."
3440,"02:36:32,042","02:36:35,879",That's fucking exactly what we want you to do. To rat.
3441,"02:36:39,967","02:36:41,802",How was Cristy's party?
3442,"02:36:41,885","02:36:42,970",Fine.
3443,"02:36:43,053","02:36:44,429",Good.
3444,"02:36:45,597","02:36:48,058","Babe, I spoke to the lawyers again today."
3445,"02:36:48,141","02:36:50,811","I have some really, really great news."
3446,"02:36:52,646","02:36:55,190","Turns out you're completely off the hook, honey."
3447,"02:36:56,149","02:36:57,818",I know that already.
3448,"02:36:57,901","02:36:59,403",Right. Exactly.
3449,"02:36:59,486","02:37:02,698","You never did anything wrong in the first place, right?"
3450,"02:37:03,657","02:37:05,867","It turns out, all the FBI really"
3451,"02:37:06,535","02:37:10,205",wants from me is to cooperate.
3452,"02:37:10,455","02:37:11,665",You know?
3453,"02:37:11,748","02:37:14,751","Turns out I have so much information about the stock market and Wall Street,"
3454,"02:37:14,835","02:37:16,628","I could save the government years of heartache,"
3455,"02:37:16,712","02:37:19,339",not to mention countless dollars.
3456,"02:37:20,841","02:37:23,176","But it gets even better, babe."
3457,"02:37:23,635","02:37:26,179","Because if I do decide to cooperate,"
3458,"02:37:26,555","02:37:29,391","I might only be looking at four short years,"
3459,"02:37:29,474","02:37:30,934","in which case, you know,"
3460,"02:37:31,018","02:37:34,062","we could start fresh, maybe sell the house."
3461,"02:37:34,146","02:37:35,772",And any fines that I'd have to pay
3462,"02:37:35,856","02:37:37,649","wouldn't be due till after I serve my term,"
3463,"02:37:37,733","02:37:40,027","so we'd still have plenty of money left over, you know?"
3464,"02:37:42,696","02:37:45,115",The only thing that of course bummed me out a little bit
3465,"02:37:45,198","02:37:50,245",is this whole idea of having to give information about my friends.
3466,"02:37:50,329","02:37:53,540","Like you said, ""There's no friends on Wall Street."" Right?"
3467,"02:37:53,624","02:37:55,584",Right. Right. Exactly.
3468,"02:37:55,667","02:37:57,252","There's a silver lining to that, too, honey."
3469,"02:37:57,336","02:37:59,004",Because they said eventually...
3470,"02:37:59,087","02:38:01,965",Eventually everyone's gonna have to give information on this case.
3471,"02:38:02,049","02:38:04,843","So, at the end of the day, it might not even be a factor. You know?"
3472,"02:38:04,926","02:38:07,054","Well, that's good news. Right?"
3473,"02:38:07,179","02:38:08,889","Yeah, yeah."
3474,"02:38:08,972","02:38:10,682",I'm really happy for you.
3475,"02:38:12,059","02:38:15,312","What do you mean, happy for me, sweetheart?"
3476,"02:38:16,229","02:38:18,815",You should be happy for the both of us. Right?
3477,"02:38:18,899","02:38:20,859","- Yeah, right. - All right."
3478,"02:38:22,944","02:38:24,571","Come here, baby."
3479,"02:38:25,072","02:38:26,615","Give me a kiss, sweetheart."
3480,"02:38:26,698","02:38:27,699",Jordan...
3481,"02:38:27,783","02:38:28,992","Oh, come on, baby."
3482,"02:38:29,076","02:38:31,286",I haven't made love to you in so long. Please.
3483,"02:38:31,370","02:38:33,789","- No. Jordan, stop it. - Come on, honey, please."
3484,"02:38:33,872","02:38:35,290","No! Jordan, stop it!"
3485,"02:38:37,042","02:38:39,252",I've loved you since the moment I saw you.
3486,"02:38:43,131","02:38:45,008","I fucking hate you, Jordan."
3487,"02:38:45,592","02:38:48,136",- Get off me! - Baby... Don't do that.
3488,"02:38:49,012","02:38:50,931","You know how much I love you, right?"
3489,"02:38:51,431","02:38:53,600","Stop that, sweetie. Please."
3490,"02:38:58,855","02:39:00,899","You wanna fuck me, Jordan?"
3491,"02:39:02,651","02:39:04,361",You wanna fuck me?
3492,"02:39:05,362","02:39:06,488",Good.
3493,"02:39:06,571","02:39:07,906",Go ahead.
3494,"02:39:08,407","02:39:10,325",Go ahead and fuck me.
3495,"02:39:11,410","02:39:13,829",I want you to fuck me real hard.
3496,"02:39:13,954","02:39:16,623",I want you to fuck me like it's the last fucking time.
3497,"02:39:16,707","02:39:18,041",- Why are you moving like that? - Come on.
3498,"02:39:18,125","02:39:19,084",Please hold still.
3499,"02:39:19,167","02:39:20,711","'Cause I want you to come for me, baby."
3500,"02:39:20,794","02:39:22,129","Come on, babe."
3501,"02:39:22,212","02:39:23,714","Come for me, baby."
3502,"02:39:23,797","02:39:25,006",I want you to come for me
3503,"02:39:25,090","02:39:26,550",like it's the last fucking time.
3504,"02:39:26,633","02:39:28,093",- Yeah? - Yeah.
3505,"02:39:28,176","02:39:30,762","Come on, baby. Come for me. Come for me, baby."
3506,"02:39:30,846","02:39:31,972","Come on, baby."
