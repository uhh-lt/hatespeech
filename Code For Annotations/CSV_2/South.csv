189,"00:09:37,947","00:09:39,531","- Jew? - No. He's talking about ""fuck."""
190,"00:09:39,615","00:09:41,241","You can't say ""fuck"" in school, you fucking fat-ass!"
191,"00:09:41,325","00:09:42,784",- Kyle! - Why the fuck not?

199,"00:09:57,049","00:10:00,343","I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Actually, what I said was..."
200,"00:10:01,095","00:10:05,473","How would you like to suck my balls, Mr. Garrison?"
201,"00:10:06,767","00:10:07,892","Holy shit, dude."
202,"00:10:10,146","00:10:13,815","Well, I must say, I'm very disappointed in you boys, m'kay?"
203,"00:10:13,899","00:10:15,525",You should be ashamed of yourselves.
204,"00:10:15,609","00:10:17,110",And I've already called in your mothers...
205,"00:10:17,194","00:10:18,945",- You called my mom? - That's right.

207,"00:10:21,740","00:10:22,782",M'kay. What?

209,"00:10:24,827","00:10:28,955","Ah! Now I wanna know where you heard these horrific obscenities, m'kay?"
210,"00:10:29,039","00:10:30,039",Nowhere.
211,"00:10:30,124","00:10:32,041",We heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before.
212,"00:10:32,126","00:10:33,751","- Yeah. - Boys, I seriously doubt"
213,"00:10:33,836","00:10:35,795","that Mr. Garrison ever said,"

215,"00:10:40,426","00:10:41,676",Sweet.

217,"00:10:45,639","00:10:47,724",Thank you all for coming on such short notice.
218,"00:10:47,808","00:10:49,309","This just isn't like you, Stanley."
219,"00:10:49,393","00:10:52,770","What did my son say, Mr. Mackey? Did he say the ""S"" word?"

221,"00:10:55,608","00:10:59,152","Well, here's a short list of the things they've been saying, m'kay?"
222,"00:10:59,236","00:11:02,155",- Oh! Dear God! - What the heck is a rim job?
223,"00:11:02,239","00:11:03,990",Why that's when you put your legs behind your head
224,"00:11:04,074","00:11:06,409",and have someone lick your ass.
225,"00:11:07,953","00:11:10,497","Young man, you will tell Mr. Mackey this instant"
226,"00:11:10,581","00:11:12,332",where you heard all these horrible phrases!
227,"00:11:12,416","00:11:13,541",I... I...
228,"00:11:13,626","00:11:15,001",We can't tell you. We all took a sacred oath
229,"00:11:15,085","00:11:16,169",and swore ourselves to secrecy.
230,"00:11:16,253","00:11:17,837",- It was the Terrance and Phillip movie. - Dude!
231,"00:11:17,922","00:11:19,672",What? Fuck you guys! I wanna get out of here!
232,"00:11:19,757","00:11:21,841",Terrance and Phillip? Those Canadians?
233,"00:11:21,926","00:11:24,010","Excuse me, what the heck is Terrance and Phillip?"
234,"00:11:24,094","00:11:27,639",Terrance and Phillip are two very untalented actors from Canada.
235,"00:11:27,723","00:11:30,058",Nothing but foul language and toilet humor.
236,"00:11:30,142","00:11:32,644","Well, I guess I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents"
237,"00:11:32,728","00:11:34,687",before more children see Terrance and Phillip.
238,"00:11:34,772","00:11:36,397",- Everybody's fucking seen it! - Eric!
239,"00:11:36,482","00:11:37,732","I'm sorry, I can't help myself."
240,"00:11:37,816","00:11:39,901",That movie has warped my fragile little mind.
241,"00:11:47,284","00:11:49,661",There's the girI that I like
242,"00:11:51,205","00:11:53,957",Over there laughing with that smart new...
243,"00:11:54,041","00:11:57,210",You're holding up the goddamn lunch line!
244,"00:11:57,378","00:11:59,754","- Hello there, children. - Hey, Chef."
245,"00:11:59,838","00:12:01,172",- How's it going? - Bad.
246,"00:12:01,257","00:12:03,258",- Why bad? - We got busted for swearing.
247,"00:12:03,342","00:12:05,760",Our moms say we can't ever see the Terrance and Phillip movie again!
248,"00:12:05,844","00:12:06,886",Oh! That's too bad.
249,"00:12:06,971","00:12:08,388",You should've seen Kyle when his mom showed up.
250,"00:12:08,472","00:12:09,889",He was scared out of his mind.
251,"00:12:09,974","00:12:11,933","- Shut up, Cartman! - No, dude. I'd be scared, too."
252,"00:12:12,017","00:12:13,059",Your mom's a fucking bitch.
253,"00:12:13,143","00:12:14,811","Don't call my mom a bitch, you fat fuck!"
254,"00:12:14,895","00:12:16,854","Don't call me fat, you butt-fucking son of a bitch!"
255,"00:12:16,939","00:12:19,440","Whoa, children, where did you learn to talk like that?"
256,"00:12:19,525","00:12:21,067","It's pretty fucking sweet, huh?"
257,"00:12:21,151","00:12:24,279","Chef, how do you make a woman like you more than any other guy?"
258,"00:12:24,363","00:12:25,405",Oh! That's easy.
259,"00:12:25,489","00:12:27,615",- You just gotta find the clitoris. - Huh?
260,"00:12:27,700","00:12:28,741",Whoops!
261,"00:12:28,826","00:12:30,827","What does that mean, ""Find the clitoris""?"
262,"00:12:30,911","00:12:32,120",Forget I said anything.
263,"00:12:32,204","00:12:34,289","Move along, children, you're holding up the line."
264,"00:12:34,373","00:12:36,416","You guys, do you know where I can find the clitoris?"
265,"00:12:36,500","00:12:37,542",The what?
266,"00:12:37,626","00:12:39,502","What, is that like finding Jesus or something?"
267,"00:12:39,587","00:12:40,670","Attention, students."
268,"00:12:40,754","00:12:43,965",We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary.
269,"00:12:44,049","00:12:47,218",Terrance and Phillip shirts are no longer allowed in school.
270,"00:12:47,303","00:12:49,178",Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt
271,"00:12:49,263","00:12:51,889",is to be sent home immediately.
272,"00:12:51,974","00:12:53,182",- Hooray! - Hooray!
273,"00:12:56,854","00:12:59,647",The R-rated Canadian film Asses of Fire
274,"00:12:59,732","00:13:01,190",is number one at the box office.
275,"00:13:01,275","00:13:03,443",But is the film destroying American youth?
276,"00:13:03,527","00:13:05,903",Here with a special report is a midget in a bikini.
277,"00:13:05,988","00:13:07,739","Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects"
278,"00:13:07,823","00:13:09,949",of the Canadian comedy are far-reaching indeed.
279,"00:13:10,034","00:13:12,327","All over America, children seem to be influenced,"
280,"00:13:12,411","00:13:14,579",like at this spelling bee in Washington.
281,"00:13:14,663","00:13:19,125","All right. This is for the silver medal. Spell ""forensics."""
282,"00:13:19,209","00:13:21,336","Fuck that! Why should I fucking have to spell ""forensics""?"
283,"00:13:21,420","00:13:22,503",- Yeah. - Yeah.
284,"00:13:22,588","00:13:26,591",Here you go. S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S. Forensics.
285,"00:13:27,384","00:13:29,802","Tom, the devastating impact of the Canadian duo"
286,"00:13:29,887","00:13:34,015","can also be seen with their new hit song Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucka."
287,"00:13:34,224","00:13:36,934","Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka"
288,"00:13:37,019","00:13:40,605",You're a boner-biting bastard Uncle fucka
289,"00:13:40,689","00:13:42,273",Thought I told you that we won't stop
290,"00:13:42,358","00:13:43,566",Thought I told you that we won't stop
291,"00:13:44,276","00:13:46,152","- Back to you, Tom. - Thanks, midget."
292,"00:13:46,236","00:13:47,195",Shocking report.
293,"00:13:47,279","00:13:49,822",The controversy began in the small mountain town of South Park
294,"00:13:49,907","00:13:52,325",where the local PTA is trying to ban the movie.
295,"00:13:52,409","00:13:55,328","With us tonight is the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski."
296,"00:13:55,412","00:13:57,955","- Hello, Tom. - And the Canadian Minister of Movies."
297,"00:13:58,040","00:13:59,165","Thanks for having me, buddy."
298,"00:13:59,249","00:14:00,625","Minister, parents are concerned"
299,"00:14:00,709","00:14:02,710",about your country's entertainment. Your thoughts?
300,"00:14:02,795","00:14:05,129","Well, the film is R-rated and is not intended for children."
301,"00:14:05,214","00:14:07,173",But of course children are gonna see it!
302,"00:14:07,257","00:14:08,841",Can I finish? The fact is that we Canadians
303,"00:14:08,926","00:14:09,884",are quite surprised by your outrage.
304,"00:14:09,968","00:14:12,845",- You just don't care! - Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish?
305,"00:14:12,930","00:14:15,682",The United States has graphic violence on television all the time.
306,"00:14:15,766","00:14:16,849",We can't believe that a movie
307,"00:14:16,934","00:14:18,393",with some foul language would piss you off so much.
308,"00:14:18,477","00:14:19,686",Because it's evil!
309,"00:14:19,770","00:14:22,146",Can I finish? Please! Can I finish?
310,"00:14:23,107","00:14:24,232","Okay, I'm finished."
311,"00:14:24,316","00:14:26,192","But, Mr. Minister, it isn't like this film"
312,"00:14:26,276","00:14:28,152",is the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada.
313,"00:14:28,237","00:14:29,821",Let us not forget Bryan Adams.
314,"00:14:29,905","00:14:31,489","Now, now. The Canadian government has apologized"
315,"00:14:31,573","00:14:32,990",for Bryan Adams on several occasions.
316,"00:14:33,075","00:14:34,534","You Canadians are all the same,"
317,"00:14:34,618","00:14:36,703",with your beady little eyes and flapping heads!
318,"00:14:36,787","00:14:38,788",- You're trash. - I resent that! I find that racist!
319,"00:14:38,872","00:14:40,456",Our children are now addicted to your filth!
320,"00:14:40,541","00:14:42,208","You are a racist, ma'am. You are a racist."
321,"00:14:42,292","00:14:43,751",It is going to take us weeks
322,"00:14:43,836","00:14:47,088",to erase the damage this film has done to our children!
323,"00:14:50,175","00:14:53,553","Kids, I wanna welcome you to rehabilitation, m'kay?"
324,"00:14:53,637","00:14:56,723",Your mothers insisted that you be taken from your normal schoolwork
325,"00:14:56,807","00:14:59,308",and placed into rehab to learn not to swear.
326,"00:14:59,393","00:15:01,060","I must say, I don't think I belong with these rogues."
327,"00:15:01,145","00:15:03,855",I attended school at Yardale and had a 4.0 grade point average.
328,"00:15:03,939","00:15:05,231","You're a fucking faggot, dude."
329,"00:15:05,315","00:15:08,443","M'kay. You see, children? This is exactly what I'm talking about."
330,"00:15:08,527","00:15:10,737",We have to get you off of foul language.
331,"00:15:10,821","00:15:13,573","- How are we gonna do that? - Well, listen here."
332,"00:15:13,657","00:15:16,576",There are times when you get suckered in
333,"00:15:16,660","00:15:20,121","By drugs and alcohol and sex with women, m'kay?"
334,"00:15:20,205","00:15:22,749",But it's when you do these things too much
335,"00:15:22,833","00:15:27,503",That you've become an addict and must get back in touch
336,"00:15:27,963","00:15:31,174","You can do it It's all up to you, m'kay?"
337,"00:15:31,759","00:15:35,428",With a little plan you can change your life today

384,"00:17:19,658","00:17:20,700",through this whole experience.
385,"00:17:20,784","00:17:24,036","I did, Terrance. I learned that you are a boner-biting dick-fart fuck-face."
386,"00:17:26,039","00:17:28,416",Want to see the northern lights?
387,"00:17:30,460","00:17:33,546",You burned yourself to death by lighting your fart!

392,"00:17:48,770","00:17:50,271",That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit.
393,"00:17:50,355","00:17:51,355",You can't do that.
394,"00:17:52,524","00:17:53,524",No way!
395,"00:17:54,651","00:17:57,653","Okay, Kenny, I'll bet you $100 you can't light a fart on fire!"

403,"00:18:32,397","00:18:33,522",Now our moms are gonna find out we went
404,"00:18:33,607","00:18:34,982",to the Terrance and Phillip movie again!
405,"00:18:35,067","00:18:36,233",Vacuum!
406,"00:18:36,318","00:18:38,903",Try to untangle his trachea and esophagus.

411,"00:18:48,872","00:18:50,331","We have precious little time left, people."
412,"00:18:50,415","00:18:51,415",We're gonna lose him soon.
413,"00:18:51,500","00:18:53,960","- Doctor, his heart stopped! - Let's get it out of there."
414,"00:18:54,044","00:18:56,295",We need to zap this quick!
415,"00:18:57,839","00:19:00,925","- Who's making a potato? - My bad, sir. I missed lunch."
416,"00:19:01,009","00:19:03,678",Damn it! I'm not gonna lose this kid!
417,"00:19:03,971","00:19:06,055",Close him up. We've done all we can.
418,"00:19:06,139","00:19:08,182",The rest is up to God.
419,"00:19:09,768","00:19:12,561","Kenny? Kenny, can you hear me?"
420,"00:19:12,646","00:19:14,188","How are you feeling, son?"
421,"00:19:15,607","00:19:17,900","Great. Son, I have some bad news."
422,"00:19:17,985","00:19:20,695",We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato.
423,"00:19:20,779","00:19:21,988",You have about three seconds to live.
424,"00:19:23,740","00:19:25,491","Ah! Fucking weak, dude!"

427,"00:19:36,420","00:19:39,338",I bet him he couldn't do it. I bet him $100.
428,"00:19:39,423","00:19:40,840","Come on, Cartman, it's not your fault."
429,"00:19:40,924","00:19:42,925","No, I know. I'm just fucking stoked I don't have to pay him."
430,"00:19:43,010","00:19:46,429","Oh! That's real nice! He was your friend, you fat fuck!"
431,"00:19:46,513","00:19:49,682","So, boys, you saw that movie again?"
432,"00:19:49,766","00:19:52,101","- Yes. - Well, Kyle, I have had it!"
433,"00:19:52,185","00:19:54,395",You are grounded for the next two weeks!

435,"00:19:58,525","00:20:00,818","And you're grounded for three weeks, Eric."
436,"00:20:00,902","00:20:03,070",Why am I grounded more? That's fucking bullshit!
437,"00:20:04,281","00:20:06,198","What? What? What? What was that word, young man?"
438,"00:20:20,881","00:20:23,799",Little boy at peace
439,"00:20:23,884","00:20:27,428",What is this place beyond the stars?
440,"00:20:27,971","00:20:30,347",Open up your eyes
441,"00:20:30,974","00:20:34,894",What are these things you're moving toward?
442,"00:20:34,978","00:20:37,980",Head so full of wonder
443,"00:20:38,065","00:20:40,399",Worries in the past
444,"00:20:40,650","00:20:43,319",Could it be that you are free at last?
445,"00:20:45,197","00:20:46,238",No!
446,"00:20:53,080","00:20:55,748",Little boy You're going to hell!
447,"00:20:55,832","00:20:57,208",You said bad words Threw rocks at the birds
448,"00:20:57,292","00:20:58,667",And now this is your hotel
449,"00:20:58,752","00:21:02,213","You ain't going back This ain't Disneyland, it's hell!"
450,"00:21:03,256","00:21:05,925","Little boy, it's time for you to pay"
451,"00:21:06,009","00:21:07,259",For hurting that bird and not going to church
452,"00:21:07,344","00:21:08,677",And staring at boobs every day
453,"00:21:08,762","00:21:11,847","Thought you were in bed Instead, you're in hell!"
454,"00:21:13,183","00:21:16,268","Hell isn't good, hell isn't good Hell!"
455,"00:21:17,521","00:21:19,688","Hell isn't good, hell isn't good Hell!"
456,"00:21:21,691","00:21:23,359","Hey, fuck-face, have you seen Gracie?"
457,"00:21:23,443","00:21:26,862",There is orderliness in the universe.
458,"00:21:27,489","00:21:29,532","Hell isn't good, hell isn't good No!"
459,"00:21:40,418","00:21:43,504","Parents, our children are out of control!"
460,"00:21:43,588","00:21:47,299",This is what happens when toilet humor is allowed to run rampant!
461,"00:21:47,384","00:21:49,468",That's right. Kenny set himself on fire
462,"00:21:49,553","00:21:52,471",because he saw Terrance and Phillip do it in that dirty movie!
463,"00:21:52,556","00:21:55,891",We must stop dirty language from getting to our children's ears!
464,"00:21:55,976","00:21:57,977",We must go fight the source of it!
465,"00:21:58,061","00:21:59,728",But what is the source?
466,"00:21:59,813","00:22:01,480",Oh! That's easy.
467,"00:22:01,773","00:22:04,650",Times have changed Our kids are getting worse
468,"00:22:04,734","00:22:08,028",They won't obey their parents They just want to fart and curse
469,"00:22:08,113","00:22:09,405",Should we blame the government?
470,"00:22:09,489","00:22:10,990",Or blame society?
471,"00:22:11,074","00:22:13,450",Or should we blame the images on TV?
472,"00:22:13,535","00:22:15,494",No! Blame Canada!
473,"00:22:15,579","00:22:16,996",Blame Canada!
474,"00:22:17,080","00:22:20,166",With all their beady little eyes and flapping heads so full of lies
475,"00:22:20,250","00:22:23,210",Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
476,"00:22:23,295","00:22:24,753",We need to form a full assault
477,"00:22:24,838","00:22:26,589",It's Canada's fault!
478,"00:22:26,756","00:22:29,842",Don't blame me for my son Stan
479,"00:22:29,926","00:22:33,012",He saw the darn cartoon and now he's off to join the Klan
480,"00:22:33,096","00:22:36,015",And my boy Eric once had my picture on his shelf
481,"00:22:36,099","00:22:38,434",But now when I see him he tells me to fuck myself
482,"00:22:38,518","00:22:41,979","Well, Blame Canada! Blame Canada!"
483,"00:22:42,063","00:22:45,232",It seems that everything's gone wrong since Canada came along
484,"00:22:45,317","00:22:48,360",Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
485,"00:22:48,445","00:22:51,655",They're not even a real country anyway
486,"00:22:51,740","00:22:54,783",My son could've been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true
487,"00:22:54,868","00:22:58,162","Instead, he burned up like a piggy on a barbecue"
488,"00:22:58,246","00:23:00,873",Should we blame the matches? Should we blame the fire?
489,"00:23:00,957","00:23:03,167",Or the doctors who allowed him to expire?
490,"00:23:03,251","00:23:04,210","Heck, no!"
491,"00:23:04,294","00:23:07,046",Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
492,"00:23:07,130","00:23:08,714",With all their hockey hullabaloo
493,"00:23:08,798","00:23:10,341","And that bitch Anne Murray, too"
494,"00:23:10,425","00:23:13,510",Blame Canada! Shame on Canada!
495,"00:23:13,595","00:23:14,553",For
496,"00:23:14,638","00:23:16,055",The smut we must stop The trash we must bash
497,"00:23:16,139","00:23:17,598",The laughter and fun must all be undone
498,"00:23:17,682","00:23:19,058",We must blame them and cause a fuss
499,"00:23:19,142","00:23:23,062",Before somebody thinks of blaming us!
500,"00:23:29,069","00:23:30,986","All right, you turds, listen up!"
501,"00:23:31,071","00:23:34,865",Your moms are away at a meeting and they put me in charge of you!
502,"00:23:34,950","00:23:38,244","But you're still grounded, so you're not allowed to have any fun!"
503,"00:23:38,328","00:23:41,497","- Any questions? - Shelly, where's the clitoris?"
504,"00:23:43,500","00:23:46,126",Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut
505,"00:23:46,211","00:23:49,505",while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
506,"00:23:51,633","00:23:52,675","Okay, it's clear."
507,"00:23:54,719","00:23:57,263",Our next guests have the number one movie in the world right now.
508,"00:23:57,347","00:23:59,265",Please welcome Terrance and Phillip!
509,"00:24:00,433","00:24:01,558",Hooray!
510,"00:24:03,436","00:24:05,437","- Hello, Conan. - Hello, Brooke Shields."
511,"00:24:05,522","00:24:07,731","Now, guys, some people claim that your Canadian humor"
512,"00:24:07,816","00:24:09,733",is nothing but immature fart jokes.
513,"00:24:09,818","00:24:13,612","That's not true. Take this classic Canadian joke, for instance."
514,"00:24:13,697","00:24:15,114","Excuse me, Terrance."
515,"00:24:15,198","00:24:16,198","Yes, Phillip?"
516,"00:24:18,451","00:24:19,451",Gosh darn it!
517,"00:24:20,870","00:24:22,913","- Good one, Phillip. Cheers. - Cheers, fuck-face."
518,"00:24:22,998","00:24:24,790","Guys, you can't say that on TV."
519,"00:24:24,874","00:24:26,250",Now Terrance smells like my ass!
520,"00:24:27,419","00:24:30,254",I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon.
521,"00:24:34,467","00:24:37,052","So, guys, does it make you nervous to be in America?"
522,"00:24:37,137","00:24:38,429",There are a lot of organizations here
523,"00:24:38,513","00:24:40,556",that want you arrested for destroying children.
524,"00:24:40,640","00:24:43,058",- Oh! They'd have to find us first. - You're right.
525,"00:24:43,143","00:24:44,143",Now!
526,"00:24:45,353","00:24:46,395","Terrance and Phillip,"
527,"00:24:46,479","00:24:50,024",Mothers Against Canada is placing you under citizen's arrest!
528,"00:24:50,108","00:24:51,650","- Mom? - Dude, what the hell is going on?"
529,"00:24:51,735","00:24:53,986",We have a court order for your arrest!
530,"00:24:54,070","00:24:55,654","Phillip, we've been ambushed!"
531,"00:24:55,739","00:24:57,323","Here you go, Conan."
532,"00:24:57,407","00:24:59,616",This little scrotum sucker deceived us!
533,"00:24:59,701","00:25:01,994","- You are a bad man! - Don't listen to them, Conan!"
534,"00:25:02,078","00:25:04,663","You loved our movie, Conan! We watched it together!"
535,"00:25:04,748","00:25:07,791",- Remember? You laughed! - What have I done?
536,"00:25:16,593","00:25:20,596",Holy crap! Did you see that? They arrested Terrance and Phillip!
537,"00:25:24,934","00:25:26,143","As the Canadian Ambassador,"
538,"00:25:26,227","00:25:28,312",I hereby condemn the actions taken by America
539,"00:25:28,396","00:25:29,355",in apprehending Terrance and Phillip.
540,"00:25:30,565","00:25:31,565","As you can see from this graph,"
541,"00:25:31,649","00:25:34,109",the entire economy of Canada relies on Terrance and Phillip!
542,"00:25:34,194","00:25:36,945","Without them, we are doomed to recession."
543,"00:25:37,197","00:25:40,199","What say you, Mr. American Ambassador?"
544,"00:25:42,452","00:25:44,703","- Fuck Canada! - Hey, fuck you, buddy!"
545,"00:25:44,788","00:25:46,663",Terrance and Phillip will not be released!
546,"00:25:46,748","00:25:49,750",They're going to be put on trial for corrupting America's youth.
547,"00:25:49,834","00:25:51,377",We don't know what all the fuss is about.
548,"00:25:51,461","00:25:53,253",The fuss is aboot taking our citizens!
549,"00:25:53,338","00:25:55,881",It's aboot not censoring our art! It's aboot... It's aboot...
550,"00:25:57,300","00:25:58,801",What's so goddamn funny?
551,"00:25:58,885","00:26:00,260","Nothing, nothing."

920,"00:43:23,929","00:43:27,056","Everyone dreams I can dream, too"
921,"00:43:27,141","00:43:31,936",Up there Up where the skies are ocean blue
922,"00:43:32,312","00:43:36,065",I could be safe and live without a care
923,"00:43:36,150","00:43:39,152",Up there
924,"00:43:39,570","00:43:42,280",They say I don't belong
925,"00:43:42,364","00:43:45,116",I must stay below alone
926,"00:43:45,617","00:43:50,663",Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sown
927,"00:43:51,874","00:43:56,961",But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme?
928,"00:43:57,337","00:43:59,422",Without evil there could be no good
929,"00:43:59,506","00:44:04,010",So it must be good to be evil sometimes
930,"00:44:05,053","00:44:07,763","Up there, there is so much room"
931,"00:44:07,848","00:44:10,933",Where babies burp and flowers bloom
932,"00:44:11,018","00:44:13,936","Everyone dreams I can dream, too"
933,"00:44:14,021","00:44:19,066",Up there Up where the skies are ocean blue
934,"00:44:19,151","00:44:23,613",I could be safe and live without a care
935,"00:44:23,697","00:44:25,865",Live without a care
936,"00:44:26,533","00:44:30,453",If only I could live up there
937,"00:44:31,455","00:44:34,040",I wanna live I wanna live
938,"00:44:38,754","00:44:42,924",I want to live up there!
939,"00:44:54,269","00:44:56,187","- You're late, Cartman! - I had to ride my bike here."
940,"00:44:56,271","00:44:58,439",- My behind is killing me! - Your behind?
941,"00:44:58,524","00:45:00,608","I have to say ""behind"" 'cause I get shocked if I say ""ass""..."
942,"00:45:01,777","00:45:05,363","- Did you bring the punch and pie? - No, you guys, something happened."
943,"00:45:05,447","00:45:07,698",- I don't think Kenny's dead. - What?
944,"00:45:07,783","00:45:08,824",I saw him in my room.
945,"00:45:08,909","00:45:11,202","I know, Cartman, I know. I see Kenny every day."
946,"00:45:11,286","00:45:13,871","- You do? - Sure, dude, on the face of every child."
947,"00:45:13,956","00:45:14,914",On the smile of every baby.
948,"00:45:16,124","00:45:18,000","Hey, I'm telling you, this was Kenny!"
949,"00:45:18,085","00:45:19,794","He said that if Terrance and Phillip die,"
950,"00:45:19,878","00:45:23,130",Saddam Hussein and Satan are gonna come up and rule the world!
951,"00:45:23,215","00:45:24,215",Saddam Hussein?
952,"00:45:29,805","00:45:30,846",Who is it?
953,"00:45:30,931","00:45:32,390",I'm here for la Résistance.
954,"00:45:32,474","00:45:35,017",- What's the password? - I don't know.
955,"00:45:35,102","00:45:37,645",- Guess. - Bacon.
956,"00:45:38,480","00:45:39,814",Okay.
957,"00:45:43,652","00:45:44,860","Oh, no, it's that kid!"
958,"00:45:44,945","00:45:47,238",- This is the place. - Wendy?
959,"00:45:47,322","00:45:49,323",Stan? You started la Résistance?
960,"00:45:50,492","00:45:52,618","Well, apparently you're more political than we thought."
961,"00:45:52,703","00:45:54,704",Let us get this meeting underway. There are others coming.
962,"00:45:58,250","00:46:00,585","Wow, a lot of people showed up."
963,"00:46:02,254","00:46:03,421",Okay.
964,"00:46:03,505","00:46:05,506","Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed,"
965,"00:46:05,591","00:46:07,717",and we think that sucks ass!
966,"00:46:09,636","00:46:10,636",Yes?
967,"00:46:10,721","00:46:13,264",We were to understand there'd be pie and punch.
968,"00:46:13,348","00:46:14,348",There isn't any.
969,"00:46:14,433","00:46:15,474",Oh!
970,"00:46:18,979","00:46:20,855","Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed,"
971,"00:46:20,939","00:46:23,190",so we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen
972,"00:46:23,275","00:46:25,651",and have pizza sent to them that they didn't order!
973,"00:46:30,616","00:46:32,116",- May I? - What?
974,"00:46:32,701","00:46:33,951",Terrance and Phillip are currently being held
975,"00:46:34,036","00:46:36,245",at a Canadian internment camp two kilometers outside of town.
976,"00:46:36,330","00:46:37,538",They're to be executed tomorrow during
977,"00:46:37,623","00:46:39,290",a star-studded USO show for the troops.
978,"00:46:39,374","00:46:40,416",Tomorrow?
979,"00:46:40,500","00:46:42,126","Once the show begins, we should have about one hour"
980,"00:46:42,210","00:46:43,628",to get Terrance and Phillip out of their cell
981,"00:46:43,712","00:46:44,754",and into this clearing.
982,"00:46:44,838","00:46:46,297","There, we will all rendezvous and, together,"
983,"00:46:46,381","00:46:48,132",take Terrance and Phillip safely back to Canada.
984,"00:46:48,216","00:46:50,051","Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart."
985,"00:46:50,135","00:46:52,803",You must all meet me at the rendezvous point at precisely 10:00 p.m.
986,"00:46:52,888","00:46:54,764",Sneaking into the show and breaking out Terrance and Phillip
987,"00:46:54,848","00:46:58,142","will be the most dangerous part, so I'll go myself."
988,"00:46:58,393","00:46:59,352",No! We're going!
989,"00:47:00,562","00:47:01,646",We started la Résistance.
990,"00:47:01,730","00:47:03,981",We'll get Terrance and Phillip and meet you at the rendezvous point.
991,"00:47:04,066","00:47:06,776",This will be very dangerous. Are you quite sure?
992,"00:47:06,860","00:47:07,985",Fuck that!
993,"00:47:08,070","00:47:09,654","Cartman, do you want that V-Chip in you forever?"
994,"00:47:09,738","00:47:11,947",We're going. Now let's run through the plan.
995,"00:47:22,376","00:47:24,585","Oh, boy! Military action, Ned!"
996,"00:47:24,670","00:47:27,463",Let's kill us some goddamn Australians!
997,"00:47:27,547","00:47:29,590",I think we're fighting Canadians.
998,"00:47:29,675","00:47:31,842","Canadians, Australians, what's the difference?"
999,"00:47:31,927","00:47:36,389","Yeah. This uniform makes me feel like a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat."
1000,"00:47:36,473","00:47:38,474","It sure does, Mr. Garrison."
1001,"00:47:38,558","00:47:40,726","Oh, boy, I can't wait for our first shore leave"
1002,"00:47:40,811","00:47:43,896",so I can get me some fucking poontang.
1003,"00:47:43,980","00:47:44,980",Pay attention!
1004,"00:47:45,065","00:47:48,317",Tomorrow night is the USO show for all you troops!
1005,"00:47:48,402","00:47:51,862","There will be celebrities, followed by the execution of Terrance and Phillip."
1006,"00:47:53,615","00:47:57,910","After the show, we will finally be sending ground troops into Canada."
1007,"00:47:57,994","00:47:59,286",So let's strategize.
1008,"00:47:59,371","00:48:00,621",Map!
1009,"00:48:01,415","00:48:03,541",Our sources have told us that the Canadians
1010,"00:48:03,625","00:48:06,502","are preparing for our invasion, so we must use caution."
1011,"00:48:06,586","00:48:08,963",Each battalion has a specific code name and mission.
1012,"00:48:09,047","00:48:11,465","Battalion Five, raise your hands."
1013,"00:48:11,550","00:48:13,884","You will be the all-important first attack wave,"
1014,"00:48:13,969","00:48:16,721",which we will call Operation Human Shield.
1015,"00:48:16,805","00:48:17,888","Hey, wait a minute!"
1016,"00:48:17,973","00:48:21,100","Now keep in mind, Operation Human Shield will suffer heavy losses."
1017,"00:48:21,184","00:48:22,685",Battalion Fourteen?
1018,"00:48:23,186","00:48:26,063",Right. You are Operation Get Behind the Darkies.
1019,"00:48:26,148","00:48:27,898",You will follow Battalion Five here.
1020,"00:48:27,983","00:48:31,736","And try not to get killed, for God's sake. Are there any questions, men?"
1021,"00:48:31,820","00:48:32,820","Yes, soldier?"
1022,"00:48:32,904","00:48:35,531",Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?
1023,"00:48:35,615","00:48:37,199",I don't listen to hip-hop.
1024,"00:48:37,284","00:48:40,077","After that, we will march into the heart of Canada and we will..."
1025,"00:48:41,455","00:48:43,289",I'm coming to get you! I'm coming to get you!
1026,"00:48:43,373","00:48:45,666",What's wrong with this thing?
1027,"00:48:46,084","00:48:49,420",It's fucking Windows 98! Get Bill Gates in here!
1028,"00:48:52,674","00:48:55,426",You told us Windows 98 would be faster and more efficient
1029,"00:48:55,510","00:48:56,927",with better access to the Internet.
1030,"00:48:57,012","00:48:59,597",It is faster. Over five million...
1031,"00:49:00,307","00:49:04,101","All right, men, get lots of rest and prepare to go into Canada!"
1032,"00:49:07,856","00:49:10,357","After you have Terrance and Phillip, quietly make your way to this ridge."
1033,"00:49:10,442","00:49:12,526","We will be waiting for you there. We cannot wait for long,"
1034,"00:49:12,611","00:49:14,445","so if you're not there at 10:00, we'll have to leave."
1035,"00:49:14,529","00:49:15,863","- Got you. - You are indeed brave,"
1036,"00:49:15,947","00:49:18,407",but you will need help from someone who's done this sort of thing before.
1037,"00:49:18,492","00:49:20,993",- Here's the address of The Mole. - The Mole?
1038,"00:49:21,077","00:49:23,454",He is an expert in covert operations. A mercenary for hire.
1039,"00:49:23,538","00:49:26,332",Your first task will be obtaining him. Get lots of sleep.
1040,"00:49:26,416","00:49:29,919","Tomorrow, we will all be risking our lives for freedom."
1041,"00:49:30,170","00:49:34,048",God has smiled upon you this day
1042,"00:49:34,841","00:49:39,553",The fate of a nation in your hands
1043,"00:49:39,638","00:49:42,306",And blessed be the children
1044,"00:49:42,390","00:49:45,142",Who fight with all our bravery
1045,"00:49:45,227","00:49:49,438",Till only the righteous stand
1046,"00:49:50,190","00:49:53,484",You see the distant flames They bellow in the night
1047,"00:49:53,568","00:49:56,862",You fight in all our names for what we know is right
1048,"00:49:56,947","00:50:00,074",And when you all get shot and cannot carry on
1049,"00:50:00,158","00:50:03,077","Though you die, la Rèsistance lives on"
1050,"00:50:03,578","00:50:06,789",You may get stabbed in the head with a dagger or a sword
1051,"00:50:06,873","00:50:09,959",You may be burned to death or skinned alive or worse
1052,"00:50:10,043","00:50:12,837",But when they torture you you will not feel the need to run
1053,"00:50:12,921","00:50:16,006",For though you die la Rèsistance lives on
1054,"00:50:16,091","00:50:19,051",Blame Canada! Blame Canada!
1055,"00:50:19,135","00:50:23,389",Because the country's gone awry Tomorrow night these freaks will fry!
1056,"00:50:23,932","00:50:26,892",Tomorrow night Our lives will change

1062,"00:50:40,115","00:50:42,700","Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka"
1063,"00:50:42,784","00:50:46,161",You're a boner-biting bastard Uncle fucka
1064,"00:50:46,246","00:50:47,621",Looks like we may be out of luck

1066,"00:50:49,291","00:50:50,708",Why did our mothers start this war?
1067,"00:50:50,792","00:50:52,293",What the fuck are they fighting for?
1068,"00:50:52,377","00:50:54,295",When did this song become a marathon?
1069,"00:50:54,379","00:50:56,714",- I want to be up there... - When Canada is dead and gone

1071,"00:50:58,341","00:51:01,427",They might cut your dick in half and serve it to a pig

1073,"00:51:04,556","00:51:07,349","But that's the way it goes In war, you're shat upon"

1081,"00:51:30,373","00:51:31,790",This book is really interesting.
1082,"00:51:31,875","00:51:34,251",It talks about how people communicate differently.

1103,"00:52:40,902","00:52:44,113",they'll put you in a Canadian concentration camp.
1104,"00:52:44,406","00:52:46,490","Don't worry, Ike, we're gonna put an end to this."
1105,"00:52:46,574","00:52:50,661",And then I'll make Mom come home and we'll all be a family again.
1106,"00:52:53,915","00:52:55,666",All of that is home.
1107,"00:53:10,724","00:53:14,518",- Hello? - Hi. We need to speak with The Mole.
1108,"00:53:14,602","00:53:18,313","I'm sorry, The Mole is grounded. He can't come out and play."
1109,"00:53:18,398","00:53:19,481",- What? - He's a kid?
1110,"00:53:19,566","00:53:21,859",He said very naughty things about God.
1111,"00:53:21,943","00:53:24,611","Oh! Well, can we just talk to him for five seconds, please?"
1112,"00:53:24,696","00:53:27,031","Well, all right. Christophe?"
1113,"00:53:29,325","00:53:31,577","Hi, we're gonna go rescue Terrance and Phillip"
1114,"00:53:31,661","00:53:32,703",from the USO show and...
1115,"00:53:32,787","00:53:34,913",- Shh! Who are you? Who sent you? - That Gregory kid.
1116,"00:53:34,998","00:53:36,206",He said you could sneak us in.
1117,"00:53:36,291","00:53:38,834","Are you telling me that you intend to break into the USO show,"
1118,"00:53:38,918","00:53:42,254","filled with thousands of soldiers, and break out Terrance and Phillip?"
1119,"00:53:42,338","00:53:44,089","I thought it was a pretty stupid idea, too."
1120,"00:53:44,174","00:53:45,215",We're la Résistance!
1121,"00:53:45,300","00:53:47,843",We wanna save Terrance and Phillip and stop the war and stuff.
1122,"00:53:47,927","00:53:51,013",I can't help you. I'm grounded in my room for the next three days.
1123,"00:53:51,097","00:53:53,140",So are we. Our parents think we're home right now.
1124,"00:53:53,224","00:53:54,224",Why are you grounded?
1125,"00:53:54,309","00:53:56,560","Why? Because God hates me, that's why."
1126,"00:53:56,644","00:53:58,187",He has made my life miserable.
1127,"00:53:58,271","00:54:00,898",So I call him a cock-sucking asshole and I get grounded.
1128,"00:54:00,982","00:54:02,900",- So will you help us? - Very well.
1129,"00:54:02,984","00:54:04,902",Meet me in the backyard in five minutes.
1130,"00:54:06,154","00:54:08,072",We'll show God that we're not gonna fucking take any more...

1135,"00:54:18,208","00:54:19,416","You better get packing, bitch."
1136,"00:54:19,501","00:54:21,376",We have to go. We're running out of time.
1137,"00:54:21,461","00:54:25,214","Saddam, sometimes you can love a person very much,"
1138,"00:54:25,298","00:54:27,132",but still know that they aren't right for you.
1139,"00:54:27,217","00:54:28,926",What the fuck are you talking about?
1140,"00:54:29,010","00:54:31,595","You treat me like shit, Saddam! I'm leaving you!"
1141,"00:54:31,679","00:54:33,806",I'm going up to Earth to rule alone!
1142,"00:54:33,890","00:54:36,391","No. No, you can't do that!"
1143,"00:54:36,476","00:54:40,354","- I'm sorry, but I have to be strong. - Satan, please, give me another chance!"
1144,"00:54:40,438","00:54:43,565",- I have to go to Earth! - You don't even have respect for me!
1145,"00:54:43,650","00:54:46,735","Sure I do, guy. Please, just hear me out."
1146,"00:54:49,989","00:54:53,200",Some people say that I'm a bad guy
1147,"00:54:53,284","00:54:56,203",They may be right They may be right
1148,"00:54:56,955","00:55:00,082",But it's not as if I don't try
1149,"00:55:00,166","00:55:03,168","I just fuck up, try as I might"

1156,"00:55:21,563","00:55:24,022","Yes, I'm insane, but it's okay 'cause I can change"
1157,"00:55:25,400","00:55:29,486",It's not my fault that I'm so evil It's society
1158,"00:55:29,571","00:55:30,946",Society
1159,"00:55:31,030","00:55:33,949","You see, my parents were sometimes abusive"
1160,"00:55:34,033","00:55:36,535",And it made a prick of me
1161,"00:55:36,619","00:55:38,745","But I can change, I can change"
1162,"00:55:38,830","00:55:41,623",What if you remain a sandy little butthole?

1167,"00:56:13,781","00:56:15,824",- Oh! All right. - All right!
1168,"00:56:15,909","00:56:19,161",- Come on. We have to hurry. - I love you.
1169,"00:56:22,957","00:56:23,999",Ladies and gentlemen

1174,"00:56:40,892","00:56:43,060",This is the USO show where those military bitches
1175,"00:56:43,144","00:56:44,519",intend to kill Terrance and Phillip.
1176,"00:56:44,604","00:56:46,396","- Oh, my God! - God?"
1177,"00:56:46,481","00:56:48,190",He is the biggest bitch of them all.
1178,"00:56:48,274","00:56:52,027",We have to hurry. We rendezvous with the other kids at 10:00.
1179,"00:56:52,487","00:56:54,529","You realize that by doing this, we could be grounded for two,"
1180,"00:56:54,614","00:56:55,906",perhaps even three weeks.
1181,"00:56:55,990","00:56:58,367",- We're willing to take that risk. - Then let's go.
1182,"00:56:58,451","00:57:00,827","And now, here are your hosts for the evening,"

1186,"00:57:12,840","00:57:16,260","No, because we're going to abolish Canadian smut!"
1187,"00:57:16,344","00:57:19,429","That's right, Sheila! Bring out the condemned!"
1188,"00:57:23,643","00:57:26,770",Today is a great day for democracy!

1199,"00:58:11,232","00:58:13,734","Yes, but they are heavily guarded."
1200,"00:58:13,818","00:58:15,694",We have to dig from here so as not to be seen.
1201,"00:58:15,778","00:58:16,862","Come on, bitches."
1202,"00:58:18,656","00:58:20,699","Hey, Mole, do you know where the clitoris is?"
1203,"00:58:20,783","00:58:21,908",- The what? - The clitoris.
1204,"00:58:21,993","00:58:24,536",I have to find the clitoris so I can get this Wendy girl to like me again.

1206,"00:58:26,414","00:58:27,456",You have to be on your toes
1207,"00:58:27,540","00:58:28,999",because I am not going to be grounded again!
1208,"00:58:29,083","00:58:30,751",Not for you. Not for anybody.
1209,"00:58:31,169","00:58:34,004","Men, when you're out there in the battlefield"
1210,"00:58:34,088","00:58:36,506",and you're looking into the beady eyes of a Canadian
1211,"00:58:36,591","00:58:39,551",as he charges you with his hockey stick or whatever he has
1212,"00:58:39,635","00:58:41,720","and people are dying all around you,"
1213,"00:58:41,804","00:58:44,306",just remember what the M. P.A.A. says.
1214,"00:58:44,390","00:58:47,184","""Horrific, deplorable violence is okay,"

1218,"00:58:57,904","00:58:59,029",Shit!
1219,"00:59:01,074","00:59:02,532","Move, move!"
1220,"00:59:03,785","00:59:07,287",Okay. We will split up here. Let's synchronize watches.
1221,"00:59:07,705","00:59:09,539",- We don't have watches. - You don't have watches?
1222,"00:59:09,624","00:59:10,707","Dude, you didn't say anything about watches!"
1223,"00:59:10,792","00:59:11,917","What do you think this is, kid?"
1224,"00:59:12,001","00:59:13,377",TV kiddie-hour where we all sit around
1225,"00:59:13,461","00:59:15,504","and lick Barney the dinosaur's fucking pussy, huh?"
1226,"00:59:15,588","00:59:17,589","This is real life, with consequences you take to the grave!"
1227,"00:59:17,673","00:59:20,467","- Dude, we don't have watches. - Shit! Did you bring the mirror?"
1228,"00:59:20,551","00:59:21,551",- Got it! - And the rope?
1229,"00:59:21,636","00:59:23,261",- Check. - And the buttfor?
1230,"00:59:23,346","00:59:26,056","- What's a buttfor? - For pooping, silly."
1231,"00:59:28,059","00:59:30,227","Now, listen carefully. I will dig under the stage,"
1232,"00:59:30,311","00:59:31,770","and with that bedrock, I will need more time."
1233,"00:59:31,854","00:59:34,564","Stan and Kyle, get near that stage and stall the show any way you can."
1234,"00:59:34,649","00:59:35,982",Do whatever it takes to keep that show going
1235,"00:59:36,067","00:59:37,776",- until I get to the prisoners. - Okay.
1236,"00:59:37,860","00:59:39,778","Cartman, over there is the electrical box."
1237,"00:59:39,862","00:59:41,279",You must sneak over there and shut it off
1238,"00:59:41,364","00:59:42,739",before I return with Terrance and Phillip
1239,"00:59:42,824","00:59:45,325",or the alarms will sound and I will be attacked by guard dogs.
1240,"00:59:45,410","00:59:46,660",- Got it? - Okay.
1241,"00:59:46,744","00:59:49,204",You must shut off the alarms! I fucking hate guard dogs!
1242,"00:59:49,288","00:59:50,664","I heard you the first time, you British piece of shit."
1243,"00:59:51,833","00:59:54,584","If anything goes wrong, make a sound like a dying giraffe."
1244,"00:59:54,669","00:59:56,503",What's a dying giraffe sound like?
1245,"01:00:00,049","01:00:01,341",- Okay. - Let's go.
1246,"01:00:01,426","01:00:03,009","- Be careful, dude. - Careful?"
1247,"01:00:03,094","01:00:05,303",Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart
1248,"01:00:05,388","01:00:08,682",with a clothes hanger while I was still in the womb?
1249,"01:00:12,437","01:00:14,271","Damn, dude. That kid is fucked up."
1250,"01:00:14,355","01:00:18,150","- How are those chairs coming, Sheila? - Al, we're minutes away."
1251,"01:00:18,234","01:00:20,235","Super! In the meantime,"
1252,"01:00:20,319","01:00:25,991","here's pint-size pixie and darling of the indie movie scene, Winona Ryder!"
1253,"01:00:26,200","01:00:27,200","Hi, guys."
1254,"01:00:28,369","01:00:30,162",I'm super psyched to be here today.

1260,"01:00:55,188","01:00:56,938","""Shut off the power, Cartman."
1261,"01:00:57,023","01:00:59,274","""This is very important, Cartman."""
1262,"01:00:59,358","01:01:01,151","Dude, did you hear what Winona Ryder's doing?"
1263,"01:01:01,235","01:01:03,028",We can't miss this.
1264,"01:01:06,574","01:01:08,408","There, I didn't miss one!"
1265,"01:01:08,493","01:01:10,785",That's my ping-pong ball trick!
1266,"01:01:14,832","01:01:17,334","Well, that's all the acts we have for you tonight,"
1267,"01:01:17,418","01:01:19,669",so let's just get on with the execution!
1268,"01:01:20,880","01:01:23,507","- Oh, no. We have to stall him. - More! More!"
1269,"01:01:23,591","01:01:25,050","Yeah, more!"
1270,"01:01:25,134","01:01:28,011",You big sillies! You want to see more of me?

1274,"01:01:36,103","01:01:37,854",But we haven't rehearsed.
1275,"01:01:37,939","01:01:39,940","- Sing it! - Yeah, sing it!"
1276,"01:01:40,024","01:01:42,859",- Oh! I can't. - Sing the fucking song!
1277,"01:01:42,944","01:01:45,695","Well, all right, if you insist, I'll sing my song."
1278,"01:01:45,780","01:01:48,240",I believe it goes a little bit like this.

1468,"01:11:44,837","01:11:47,171","Good job, Ms. Broflovski! Thanks a lot!"
1469,"01:11:47,256","01:11:50,633",I was just trying to make the world a better place for children.
1470,"01:11:50,717","01:11:52,760","Yeah, and you brought enough intolerance"
1471,"01:11:52,845","01:11:54,470",to the world to allow my coming.
1472,"01:11:54,555","01:11:57,473","Now, everyone bow down to me!"

1475,"01:12:03,939","01:12:06,566","Saddam, I am the dark ruler, not you."
1476,"01:12:06,650","01:12:08,526","Relax, bitch. You're better seen, not heard."
1477,"01:12:09,820","01:12:11,237",I can't.
1478,"01:12:11,321","01:12:13,948",Let's start by building a big statue of me
1479,"01:12:14,032","01:12:15,992",right over there where that fat kid is standing.
1480,"01:12:16,076","01:12:18,744","Hey, don't call me fat, butt-fucker!"
1481,"01:12:24,543","01:12:26,419","Yeah, Cartman, do it!"
1482,"01:12:26,503","01:12:29,755",Damn! Shit! Respect my fucking authority!

1487,"01:12:43,145","01:12:45,104",Try this on for size.

1489,"01:12:50,944","01:12:55,448","Hey, buddy, I know I was mean before, but don't worry, I can change."
1490,"01:12:55,741","01:12:56,782",Oh!
1491,"01:12:56,950","01:12:58,201",Okay.
1492,"01:12:59,703","01:13:00,786",Not!

1499,"01:13:21,892","01:13:23,976",I have had enough of you!
1500,"01:13:26,146","01:13:29,315","Hey, guy, relax!"
1501,"01:13:38,200","01:13:41,702",He spent so much time convincing me I was weak and stupid
1502,"01:13:41,787","01:13:44,080",that I believed it myself.
1503,"01:13:44,957","01:13:47,124","I have you to thank, little one."
1504,"01:13:47,209","01:13:49,752",You showed me that I had to get away from him.
1505,"01:13:49,836","01:13:53,130","Just make any wish you want, and I shall grant it."
1506,"01:13:56,009","01:13:58,052","- Are you sure, Kenny? - What did he say?"
1507,"01:13:58,136","01:14:00,805",He said that his wish is for everything to go back to the way it was
1508,"01:14:00,889","01:14:02,765",before this horrible war.
1509,"01:14:02,849","01:14:06,102","Kenny, you realize that means you'd go back, too?"
1510,"01:14:15,862","01:14:19,115","Oh! Very well, then. I will pull all my minions back."
1511,"01:14:19,199","01:14:22,493",I guess I'm destined to live in hell. Alone.
1512,"01:14:24,204","01:14:26,122",Hello. What's this?
1513,"01:14:26,707","01:14:30,876","Hi, there, little guy. Would you like to go to hell with me?"
1514,"01:14:31,628","01:14:35,298","Sure. I bet we could be best friends, Mr. Satan."
1515,"01:14:35,382","01:14:38,301","Feel free to come back and visit us any time you want, Satan."
1516,"01:14:38,385","01:14:40,136",I just might do that.
1517,"01:14:40,220","01:14:41,220","Thank you, Kenny."
1518,"01:14:41,305","01:14:42,555","Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us."
1519,"01:14:42,639","01:14:44,473",You're a real pal.
1520,"01:14:48,895","01:14:50,688","Goodbye, you guys."
1521,"01:15:03,243","01:15:05,202",I'm alive. Where's Mr. Hat?
1522,"01:15:05,287","01:15:07,913",Wow! We were all dying and now we're fine!
1523,"01:15:07,998","01:15:09,582",That's super!
1524,"01:15:09,666","01:15:11,834",What the fuck's going on?
1525,"01:15:15,756","01:15:16,964","You see, Mom? After all that,"
1526,"01:15:17,049","01:15:19,675",it was Cartman's filthy fucking mouth that saved us all.
1527,"01:15:19,760","01:15:22,803","I'm sorry I didn't pay attention to you, Kyle."
1528,"01:15:25,265","01:15:26,932","But, Wendy, what about Gregory?"
1529,"01:15:27,017","01:15:28,851","Stan, I never really cared for Gregory."
1530,"01:15:28,935","01:15:30,644","- You didn't? - No, dude. Fuck Gregory!"
1531,"01:15:30,729","01:15:34,023","- Fuck him right in the ear! - Yay! Thank you, clitoris."
1532,"01:15:34,107","01:15:37,693",Everything worked out What a happy end
1533,"01:15:37,778","01:15:41,989",Americans and Canadians are friends again
1534,"01:15:42,074","01:15:45,034",So let's all join hands and knock oppression down
1535,"01:15:45,118","01:15:46,202","Good Lordy, I'm found"
1536,"01:15:46,286","01:15:49,080",Don't you know our little lives are now complete?
