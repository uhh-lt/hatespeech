0,What the fuck are you thinking?
1,There's a black guy outside breaking into your car.
2,How long has he been there?
3,I don't know.
4,What's going on?
5,"Not right now, honey. How many?"
6,"Danny, how many?"
7,"One, I think."
8,Is he strapped?
9,Does he have a gun?
10,I don't fucking know.
11,Wait a second.
12,What the fuck is going on?
13,Stay right here and be quiet.
14,"Wait a second, Derek. Wait."
15,Stay right here.
16,I don't have a personal problem with him.
17,"Don't insult my intelligence, Murray."
18,"You hate this child, and I think I know why."
19,Dr. Sweeney's office.
20,I went out with his mother a few times.
21,That was three years ago.
22,It was nothing.
23,Nothing. Really?
24,"That paper Bob, it's a travesty."
25,Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights hero.
26,You've got to draw the line.
27,on any book that related to the struggle for civil rights...
28,in plain English.
29,I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused...
30,and harbors some sick ideas...
31,but I am not ready to give up on him yet.
32,His brother probably put him up to it.
33,I guarantee you 100%%...
34,his brother did not put him up to this.
35,I find that hard to believe.
36,I know he was a good kid...
37,"and it's a shame what he's been through, but that's dangerous."
38,Dangerous in what way?
39,That goes too far.
40,"This racist propaganda, ""Mein Kampf"" psychobabble..."
41,"he learned this nonsense, and he can unlearn it, too."
42,I will not give up on this child yet.
43,I knew it was you.
44,"Danny, get in here."
45,I said get in here!
46,Get in here!
47,"Five, four, three, two..."
48,Shut the door!
49,"What's it gonna be, Danny?"
50,What's what gonna be?
51,This petty crap you're pulling.
52,I don't know.
53,Have a seat.
54,How are you doing?
55,Fine.
56,Things at home OK?
57,"Derek got out this morning, did he not?"
58,"Yeah, he did."
59,He was one of my students.
60,"You knew that, right?"
61,Honors English.
62,He was a brilliant student like you...
63,"but he hung out with fools, also like you."
64,Did you bring me in here to talk about Derek?
65,What happened to him has nothing to do with me.
66,Everything you do right now has something to do with Derek.
67,I followed directions.
68,"I wrote an ""A"" Paper."
69,"""Mein Kampf""?"
70,I should expel you.
71,Go ahead. You don't think I could handle it?
72,No. I think the street would kill you.
73,Your rhetoric and your propaganda...
74,aren't going to save you out there.
75,So here's the drill.
76,I'm your history teacher from now on.
77,We will discuss current events.
78,We will call this class...
79,American History X.
80,We meet once a day.
81,All right.
82,Your first assignment...
83,is to prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.
84,"Come on, Sweeney. It took me a week to read ""Mein Kampf."" What do you want me to do it on?"
85,Your brother.
86,"Oh, God, man."
87,Please tell me you're joking.
88,No. I'm not kidding.
89,I want you to analyze and interpret all the events...
90,surrounding Derek's incarceration.
91,How these events helped shape your present perspective...
92,concerning life in contemporary America.
93,"The impact on your life, your family's."
94,"Whatever you want to say, Danny."
95,I'll be the only one reading it.
96,But if it's not on my desk tomorrow morning...
97,you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.
98,You clear?
99,"Yeah, I'm clear."
100,Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating!
101,Is that what's happening?
102,I never cheated in my life.
103,Beat his motherfucking ass.
104,I didn't say anything!
105,Why you tripping on me?
106,Now why you all kicking it like that?
107,"What's up, man?"
108,What you scared for?
109,I ain't gonna do nothing.
110,What's up?
111,"Want some, too, bitch?"
112,"Punk, what's wrong with you?"
113,You want to die?
114,Punkass white boy.
115,You lucky I gotta go to class.
116,He ain't gonna do nothing.
117,He don't wanna see me and the heater.
118,Lucky the bell rung.
119,I would have clocked that white boy.
120,Punkass motherfucker.
121,Should smoke that fool.
122,You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.
123,We got a whole file on skinheads here.
124,Part of the same gang?
125,Venice Beach gang.
126,"Actually, he's done a stretch at Y.A."
127,"This guy C.C., is that him?"
128,"Yeah, that's him right there."
129,"This morning we have a guest, and there he is."
130,Good morning.
131,"Morning, sir."
132,Good to see you.
133,Good morning.
134,This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
135,He's principal over at Venice Beach High.
136,"For some time now, he's been doing outreach work..."
137,with gangs both in and out of the can.
138,"Three years ago, a local kid named Derek Vinyard..."
139,was sent up for murdering a couple of Crips...
140,who were trying to jack his car.
141,"Bob taught Vinyard, and he's followed this case closely."
142,"He was a skinhead, right?"
143,"He was more like ""the"" skinhead..."
144,the prot g  of Cameron Alexander.
145, Who?
146, Cameron Alexander.
147,Here you go. Have a looksee.
148,"Cameron Alexander, well, he's a Venice Beach landmark."
149,He's the biggest distributor and writer...
150,of White Power literature and videos in L.A. County.
151,"He promotes White Power bands, he writes reviews..."
152,"and in his spare time, this guy even writes hate columns."
153, Does he have a record?
154, He's pretty clean.
155,"Been trying to pin something to him, but it doesn't work."
156,Trust me.
157,He's behind all of it.
158,He runs everything out of his house by the beach.
159,There were no white gangs in Venice Beach...
160,before Cameron Alexander and Derek Vinyard hooked up.
161,Alexander found in Derek his shining prince.
162,"Essentially, he used Derek to recruit..."
163,"a slew of insecure, frustrated, and impressionable kids."
164,"This kid Vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage..."
165,as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of NBC.
166,"Earlier today, L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard..."
167,was shot and killed battling a blaze...
168,at a suspected Compton drug den.
169,We're at the Vinyard home now...
170,and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek...
171,has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
172,"Derek, if you could come down here please for a second."
173,"Look, I know this is tough, but how do you feel right now?"
174,How do you think I feel?
175, I think it's typical.
176, Typical how?
177,"Well, this country's becoming a haven for criminals..."
178,so what do you expect?
179,Decent hardworking Americans like my dad...
180,are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
181,Parasites?
182,"Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever."
183,I don't understand.
184,You think maybe your father's murder was racerelated?
185,"Yeah, it's racerelated."
186,Every problem in this country is racerelated.
187,Not just crime.
188,"It's immigration, AIDS, welfare."
189,Those are problems of the black community...
190,"the Hispanic community, the Asian community."
191,They're not white problems.
192,Aren't those really issues that deal more with poverty?
193,No. They're not products of their environments.
194,Minorities don't give two shits about this country.
195,"They come here to exploit it, not to embrace it."
196,Millions of white Europeans came here and flourished...
197,within a generation.
198,What the fuck is the matter with these people?
199,They have to go around shooting at firemen.
200,What does this have to do with the murder of your father?
201,Because my father was murdered doing his job!
202,Putting out a fire in a fucking nigger neighborhood...
203,he shouldn't have given a shit about.
204,He got shot by a fucking drug dealer...
205,who probably still collects a welfare check.
206,Derek Vinyard was quietly released from Chino...
207,early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
208,I think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
209,If something happens to him...
210,things could get very ugly down by the beach.
211,Just keep it low.
212,Venice Beach didn't always look like this.
213,It used to be a great neighborhood.
214,The boardwalk's always been a dump...
215,but when my dad moved us out here...
216,"Venice was a nice, quiet place to grow up."
217,"Over the years, though, it's just gone to hell."
218,The gangs are like a plague.
219,They moved west from Inglewood and South Central...
220,and basically took over.
221,I ain't fouling you!
222,I ain't got time for all this bullshit.
223,Fuck y'all.
224,You all right?
225,I'm all right.
226,"Yo, is that that fool you was telling me about?"
227,"Yeah, that's that motherfucker."
228,"Yeah, man, that's him."
229,Bitchass motherfucker.
230,That's why Derek started the D.O.C.
231,He said white kids shouldn't have to walk around scared...
232,"in their own neighborhood, and for a while there..."
233,we really made it like it was ours again.
234,Throw the ball!
235,"Come on, Curtis!"
236,Quit chucking it up.
237,Pass the ball.
238,"""D"" up!"
239,"Come on, let's go."
240,Look at this fucking jungle bunny.
241,He does a spin move every time.
242,"You ain't getting shit, motherfucker."
243,"This one's for you, boy!"
244,"What the fuck you Who you calling boy, motherfucker?"
245,"You're lucky, motherfucker!"
246,I'm through monkeying around with your fucking ass!
247,"Pale, pasty, pastramieating, cracker motherfucker."
248,A hundred bucks say I make you my bitch.
249,Hear that?
250,He's trying to make ends meet...
251,for his cut in welfare.
252,You're on!
253,"It's eightsix, Seth."
254,"When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it."
255,Come on. I can't cover this.
256,Help me out here.
257,You got a big fucking mouth.
258,I can take this niglet down.
259,You couldn't take a shit.
260,What are you thinking?
261,I will beat him.
262,Give me the money.
263,Shut up.
264,You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
265,I'll take care of this.
266,"Yo, I ain't got time for this."
267,Hey!
268,I got a bet.
269,I come in this game right now.
270,Same score...
271,but we play black guys against the white guys.
272,"Name your price, cracker."
273,No money. For these courts.
274,And not just today. For good.
275,"If you win, we will walk away..."
276,"but if we win, no bitching, no fighting."
277,"Right here in front of everybody, pack up your shit..."
278,and get your black asses out of here.
279,Fuck that. Take this bet.
280,Eight to six. Our ball.
281,Let's go.
282,Pick him up!
283,"Seth, get back and play some ""D."" Defense!"
284,Pass the fucking ball!
285,I was wide open!
286,Bullshit.
287,That's fucking offense.
288,Get out of here.
289,He moved his feet.
290,"You want to go, I'm ready!"
291,Don't throw elbows at me!
292,"You want to go, Adolf Hitler wannabe motherfucker?"
293, You OK?
294, Yeah. Give me some water.
295,You gotta call offense on that shit.
296,"Not on game point, Danny."
297,You can't let those niggers get away with that shit.
298,It's game point.
299,Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.
300,Watch this.
301,Byebye.
302,Get the fuck off my court!
303,This is my house!
304,"Fuck you, bitch!"
305,Get the fuck out of here!
306,This is my court!
307,Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.
308,He said it would make it just too hard for him...
309,"and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow."
310,"Three years without him, just wondering."
311,And then at 7:00 this morning...
312,we picked him up outside the gate.
313,"The whole ride back, he didn't say anything."
314,"I wanted to stay home, but he said..."
315,"""No. Go to school."
316,"I'll see you later."" Oh, come on."
317,Give the guy a break.
318,"What? You too big to give me a hug, tough guy?"
319,"No, man. I just know you're gonna need someone..."
320,to look after you while you adjust to all this space.
321,"Yeah, right."
322,This place is smaller than the old living room.
323,How you doing? How's school?
324,It's good.
325,You gotta do something about that hair.
326,That do's has gotta go.
327, The girls like it.
328," Well, I don't."
329,You're keeping it pretty close.
330,You took it all the way down.
331,"Shit. Look. I forgot, man."
332,It hurt like shit when they put it on.
333,When'd you get that?
334,I got it about a month ago.
335,Cameron made it official.
336,He put this on you?
337,What?
338,"Oh, hi. He's here."
339,"Derek, it's for you."
340,Nothing.
341,Is there a phone in the back?
342,I'll get it in the back.
343,I got it. Yeah?
344,"Oh, hey."
345,What?
346,My eyes have seen the glory...
347,of the trampling at the zoo.
348,We've washed ourselves in nigger's blood...
349,"and all the mongrels, too."
350,We're taking down the Zog machine...
351,Jew by Jew by Jew.
352,The white man marches on.
353,You think our friend was behind that?
354,I don't even care.
355,I'm gonna take care of that tonight.
356,My sweet kids. My baby boy.
357,"God, what's with the love fest, you guys?"
358,No. He'll do it.
359,I'll make sure he does it.
360,I'll get it.
361,I came to see the man.
362, Can you fit through the door?
363, Fuck you!
364,"What's up, Dan? How you doing?"
365, Where's Derek?
366, He's on the phone.
367,"Come out, you free motherfucker!"
368,Where the fuck are you?
369,Hang on. Give me a minute.
370,I'll be out in a minute.
371,I'll be careful.
372,I'm not gonna stay in my room the rest of my life.
373,Hold on.
374,Hey. What the fuck is Seth doing here?
375,Did you invite him over?
376,No. He always comes over here.
377,"Danny, give me a minute."
378,Just give me one minute.
379,"Are you still here, Goodyear?"
380,"You calling me a blimp, you fucking Democrat?"
381,When was the last time you were actually able to see your feet?
382,"Come in here, Danny."
383,Are you going to Cam's party tonight?
384,Is Davina's ass watertight?
385,"You're fucking sick, man."
386,"All right, relax."
387,Let me ask you a few questions.
388,I'm not in the mood.
389,I got homework.
390,"Tell me some of the shit you've learned, fuckass..."
391,before I pistolwhip you.
392,"OK. I believe in death, destruction..."
393,"chaos, filth, and greed."
394,"Cut the shit, Dan. Come on."
395,Tell me what I want to hear.
396,You mean that shit about your mother?
397,"You want to get fucking beaten, Danny?"
398,I'm not fucking talking to you.
399,Shut up.
400,"Look, you gotta let me do this my own way, all right?"
401,I'll take care of it.
402,"Who do you hate, Danny?"
403,I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.
404,Why?
405,They're a burden to the advancement of the white race.
406,Some are all right.
407,"None of them are fucking all right, OK?"
408,They're all a bunch of fucking freeloaders.
409,We don't know 'em.
410,We don't want to know 'em.
411,They're the fucking enemy.
412,What don't you like about them...
413,and say it with some fucking conviction.
414,I hate the fact it's cool to be black these days.
415,Good.
416,I hate this hiphop influence on white fucking suburbia.
417,Good.
418,I hate Tabitha Soren and her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...
419,telling us we should get along.
420,"Save the rhetorical bullshit, Hillary Rodham Clinton..."
421,'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
422,That's some of the best shit I've ever heard.
423,"I feel sorry for you, Danny."
424,"You don't believe any of that shit, right?"
425,Shut up.
426,"No. Get out of the house now, you piece of shit."
427,"Is that any way to talk to a guest, a friend?"
428,"Derek hates you, and you don't realize it."
429,How do you know who I hate?
430,Back from the dead.
431,God bless Jesus Christ.
432,"God, I think you lost weight."
433,I can get my arms almost all the way around you.
434,"Fifty fucking pounds, man."
435,Look at this hair. Holy shit.
436,I told him it's gotta go.
437,Grab your jacket.
438,Let's get the fuck out of here.
439,I want to talk to him.
440,One second.
441,"Hey, listen. Did you pull some shit in school today?"
442, Just the usual.
443, This kid is awesome as hell.
444,"Did you turn in a paper on ""Mein Kampf""?"
445, Sweeney shit his pants.
446," He did, man."
447,Was that your idea or did Cameron put you up to that?
448,No. I thought it would be cool.
449,How'd you know?
450,It doesn't matter how I knew.
451,This kid is smart as hell.
452,Was that Sweeney on the phone?
453,Sweeney called and told me.
454,"God, I hate that fucking nigger, man."
455,He's gotta get a fucking life.
456,Sweeney's a good teacher.
457,Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip.
458,That's what he was like when we were there...
459,and that's how he is now.
460,It'll never change.
461,Fuck that nigger!
462," Seth, go away."
463, Are you kidding?
464,Nope. Wait in Danny's room.
465,I want to talk to my brother.
466,I've been here 15 minutes.
467,I'm starving.
468,"Come here. Seriously, look."
469,Forget this yahoo.
470,He kills bugs for a living.
471,You don't want to be like that.
472,I'm serious. It's not funny.
473,Sweeney is a good teacher.
474,You can learn a lot from him.
475,Don't go fuck it up with small fry shit like that.
476,You don't understand.
477,You got to see the bullshit paper he's making me write.
478,He told me all about it.
479,I don't care.
480,You do anything he tells you to do. I mean it.
481,I don't want you getting in trouble in school...
482,"trying to impress me, taking this shit in there."
483,Do you understand what I'm saying?
484,"Yeah, I guess, but, I mean, I thought you'd be happy."
485,"Well, I'm not."
486,Listen to that.
487,"Yeah, I know."
488,It's been getting worse.
489,Don't worry about it.
490,I'll talk to you about this later.
491,She's coughing her lungs out...
492,and you're blowing this in her face all day.
493,I'm putting it out.
494,"Hey, come on."
495,I want to talk to you.
496,"Mommy, are you OK?"
497,Put that out.
498,I was just yelling at him for blowing smoke in your face.
499,"Nice thing to come home to, huh?"
500,You all right?
501,You all right?
502,"Look, you got to take it easy."
503,You got to get some rest.
504,"Take Danny's and my room, and we'll hit the couch."
505,I've been on the couch for ages.
506,The couch is fine.
507,"No, it's not fine."
508,This is terrible.
509,We can't live like this.
510,We gotta get out of here.
511,Can I go with you?
512,Yeah.
513,We all gotta get out of here.
514, I could drop out and get a job.
515, Absolutely not.
516,You got to finish.
517,I'll work something out.
518,"Derek, can we please go eat?"
519,I'm fucking starving here.
520,Go wait in the living room.
521,I want him out of my house.
522,I know. Look.
523,He's an idiot.
524,He's always been an idiot.
525,He can't help it.
526,I got to do that paper.
527,I'll catch up with you later tonight.
528,Not at Cameron's. I need you to stay away from there.
529, We were going to hang.
530, I'll explain it later.
531,"I just need you to stay away from the party, all right?"
532,Whatever.
533,Promise me you'll stay away from that party tonight.
534,"I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?"
535,Whatever.
536,God!
537,"Come on, let's go."
538,Where are you parked?
539,Out back.
540,"Yeah, that's the whole bunch."
541,It didn't take long for Derek to make a name for himself...
542,and Cameron knew just how to use it.
543,You don't want to stick around?
544,"You know I'd love to, but I got to be careful."
545,"Yeah, I know."
546,I'll see you back at the house.
547,Good luck.
548,"He sent Derek to the kids, to the frustrated ones..."
549,the ones who were sick of getting their asses kicked...
550,by black and Mexican gangs.
551,"""Don't just be some punk."
552,"Be part of something."" All right, let's go."
553,Pull it together.
554,And everybody ate it up.
555,They did whatever Derek told them to.
556,Let's go. We're not here to fucking socialize.
557,Shut the fuck up.
558,"Yeah, man."
559,You want a little toke?
560,Go ahead.
561," Curtis, what is that?"
562," Come on, Derek."
563,Weed is for niggers.
564,Put that away right now.
565,Jesus fucking Christ.
566,Have a little selfrespect.
567,"All right, listen up."
568,We need to open our eyes.
569,There's over two million illegal immigrants...
570,bedding down in this state tonight.
571,This state spent three billion dollars last year...
572,on services for those people who had no right to be here.
573,Three billion dollars.
574,$400 million just to lock up illegal immigrant criminals...
575,who only got into this country because the INS decided...
576,it's not worth the effort to screen for convicted felons.
577,Our government doesn't give a shit.
578,"Our border policy is a joke, so is anybody surprised..."
579,that south of the border they're laughing at us?
580,Laughing at our laws?
581,"Every night, thousands of these parasites..."
582,stream across the border like some fucking pi ata exploded.
583,Don't laugh.
584,There's nothing funny here.
585,This is about your life and mine.
586,"It's about decent, hardworking Americans..."
587,falling through the cracks and getting the shaft...
588,because their government cares more about the rights...
589,of a bunch of people who aren't even citizens.
590,On the Statue of Liberty it says...
591,"""Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."" Well, it's Americans who are tired and hungry and poor."
592,Until you take care of that...
593,"close the fucking book, because we're losing."
594,We're losing our right to pursue our destiny.
595,We're losing our freedom so a bunch of fucking foreigners...
596,can come in here and exploit our country.
597,And this isn't something that's going on far away.
598,This isn't happening places we can't do anything about it.
599,It's happening here.
600,Right in our neighborhood.
601,Right in that building behind you.
602,Archie Miller ran that grocery store since we were kids here.
603,Dave worked there.
604,Mike worked there.
605,"He went under, and now some fucking Korean owns it..."
606,who fired these guys and is making a killing...
607,because he hired I see this shit going on...
608,and I don't see anybody doing anything about it...
609,and it fucking pisses me off.
610,So look around you.
611,This isn't our fucking neighborhood.
612,It's a battlefield.
613,We're on a battlefield tonight.
614,Make a decision.
615,Are we going to stand on the sidelines?
616,Quietly standing there while our country gets raped?
617,Are we going to ante up and do something about it?
618,You're goddamn right.
619,Come here!
620,Don't you know it's illegal...
621,"to hire fucking border jumpers, you nip bastard?"
622,"Hey, sweetheart."
623,No. You don't need this.
624,We're not going to hurt you.
625,"Please, please! No!"
626,You fucking spic!
627, No! Please!
628, This bitch deserves it.
629,This bitch stinks. Smells like fish and chips and guacamole.
630,Here we go.
631,Goddamn!
632,"Get the fuck off me, motherfucker!"
633,Viva la Mexico!
634,"Have a fucking bean, you fucking beaner!"
635,Get some of that in there.
636,Throw it on.
637,That's a great color on you.
638,Now you can get a white woman's job.
639,"A little better than this one, huh?"
640,"Yeah, white."
641,Then you'll move up in the world.
642,Asshole!
643,Let's go!
644,Everybody out!
645,Now! Now!
646,"All right, let's go!"
647,Come on!
648,"Come on, let's go."
649,"No green card, no fucking work."
650,Comprende?
651,Come on!
652,We're fucking going! Come on!
653,"Dad was gone, but things were almost normal again."
654,Derek had a good job.
655,Mom was starting to live a little.
656,"Everyone was feeling so good, we just didn't see it coming."
657,Maybe we should've.
658,The irony is that most of the stores...
659,destroyed during the riots were owned by black people.
660,"That's stupid, though."
661,Why trash your own neighborhood?
662,"Well, that's my point."
663,It's an irrational act.
664,It's like an expression of rage...
665,by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.
666,It's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68.
667,I don't buy that.
668,Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage.
669,That's such a copout.
670,It's opportunism at its worst.
671,It's people grabbing any excuse they can find...
672,"to go and loot a store, nothing more."
673,The fact that these people ripped off the stores...
674,"in their own communities, all that reflects..."
675,is that they have no respect for the law at all...
676,and certainly no concept of community...
677,or civic responsibility.
678,Now wait a minute.
679,"White people commit crimes against white people, too."
680,"Yeah, but they're not offing each other in record numbers."
681,"Look at the statistics, for Christ's sake."
682,One in every three black males...
683,is in some phase of the correctional system.
684,Is that a coincidence...
685,or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
686,Not only that.
687,They're proud of it.
688,Maybe it says something about prejudice...
689,in the judicial system.
690,If you want to talk about criminal statistics...
691,take a look at the social inequalities that produce them.
692,That's exactly what I hate.
693,You're taking one thing and calling it something else...
694,and just alleviating the responsibility...
695,these people have for their own actions.
696,"It's like saying, it's not a riot, it's rage."
697,"It's not crime, it's poverty."
698,That's just nonsense.
699,It's exactly what happened in this trial...
700,because the media twisted things around...
701,so people got all focused on these cops...
702,and whether or not they were going to get convicted...
703,and whether Rodney King's civil rights had been violated.
704,Everybody lost sight of old Rodney King himself.
705,The guy's a multiple felon by his own admission.
706,He's high as a goddamn kite...
707,driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
708,He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops...
709,and he attacks them.
710,He attacked police officers.
711,"That's the bottom line, and he walked."
712,And there's some yahoo there with a video camera...
713,who turned it on halfway through...
714,so that all we see is them hitting him.
715,You got Powell and Koon cracking him with billy clubs...
716,and Briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull...
717,"so it looks severe, you know?"
718,"People are going, ""Oh, this poor guy."" This poor guy who attacked four cops..."
719,and those cops end up on the stand...
720,defending themselves for using standard textbook procedures.
721,I don't think the tapes showed that at all.
722,You didn't think so?
723,And you're an authority?
724,"Murray, what do you think?"
725,I did think the police used their clubs rather excessively.
726,Who are you to say what's excessive?
727,I think it was totally appropriate.
728,They're in a better position to make that call than you are.
729,"We, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority..."
730,"to make those calls, because we acknowledge..."
731,that their job is difficult and dangerous.
732,Very few people respect that and respect that authority.
733,Look who's talking about respectMr. Junior KKK.
734,What?
735,You want to go to college?
736,Learn to listen.
737,I didn't say I respect the laws.
738,I acknowledge a cop's authority.
739,I don't respect laws that let Rodney King back on the street.
740,"Second, I am not a member of a lowrent..."
741,disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK. Please.
742,So take your head out of your ass.
743,You've gotten off the point.
744,I had a point.
745,That wasn't even the point.
746,Do you have one?
747,What is your point?
748,"All right, think about this."
749,If Danny was walking across the street that night...
750,and Rodney King plowed into him Can we drop this Rodney King thing?
751,Who would like some dessert?
752,We're having a discussion.
753,"We're having a nice discussion, right?"
754,If Rodney King had been driving along...
755,hopped up on PCP and had killed Danny...
756,"you'd be singing a different tune I didn't see him hit anybody, and neither did you."
757,"He didn't happen to kill anybody, thank God."
758,"Keep it down, OK?"
759,Ally's sleeping.
760,If that fucking monkey had run some kid over...
761,everybody would have a very different opinion.
762,They'd be focused on Rodney King and not on these officers.
763,"But instead, he just attacked a few cops..."
764,"so, suddenly, it's Hands Across America..."
765,for this fucking total son of a bitch.
766,It blows my mind.
767,We're so hung up on this notion that we have some obligation...
768,to help this struggling black man.
769,Cut him some slack until he can overcome...
770,these historical injustices.
771,It's crap. This stuff just perpetuates it...
772,all this liberal nonsense.
773,Everyone's looking the other way...
774,while our country rots from the inside out.
775,"I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves 130 years ago."
776,How long does it take to get your act together?
777,"Jews have been persecuted for over 5,000 years."
778,Are you saying it's wrong to feel sensitive...
779,about antiSemitism?
780,"Oh, forget that."
781,"I'm with you. I'm with you all the way, baby."
782,I'm so sick of these liberal hypocrites.
783,Here we go again.
784,I love this part.
785,This is great.
786,Look how they scapegoated Chief Gates.
787,Think they would've come down that hard on Willie Williams?
788,No way. That videotape was a setup to get rid of Gates.
789, Can I be excused?
790, No. Don't interrupt.
791,Excuse me. I was talking.
792,I listened to you.
793, Who do you think you are?
794, She's making a point.
795,"Davina, sit down."
796,Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!
797," Derek, calm down."
798, Don't tell him to shut up!
799,Sit your ass down. No.
800,Sit down. Shut your mouth.
801,Move! Goddamn it! Move!
802,Shut your mouth and give my girlfriend respect.
803,"Derek, what are you trying to prove?"
804,"Murray, stay out of it!"
805,Where do you think you're going?
806,"Derek, let her go!"
807,"You need to learn some fucking manners, Davina!"
808,Shut your fucking mouth!
809,Stop!
810,She can't breathe!
811,Let her go!
812,You going to apologize?
813,You're a fucking asshole.
814,I hate you!
815,What are you doing?
816,This is your family.
817,Right.
818,"My family, so you know what?"
819,I don't give two shits about you or what you think.
820,You're not a part of it.
821, That has nothing to do with it.
822, It doesn't?
823,You don't think I see what you're doing?
824,You think I'll sit here and smile...
825,while some fucking kike tries to fuck my mother?
826,It's never going to happen.
827,Fucking forget it.
828,Not while I'm in this family.
829,I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off...
830,and stick it up your ass before I let that happen.
831,Coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner...
832,"with your Jewish, niggerloving, hippie bullshit."
833,Fuck you. Fuck you.
834,"Yeah, walk out."
835,Asshole. Fucking cabalareading motherfucker.
836,Get out of my house.
837,You see this?
838,That means not welcome.
839,What did I do?
840,You disgust me.
841,"Bring him to our table, primping your hair and your dress."
842,What did I do?
843,You're all tarted up.
844,How could you bring him to my father's table?
845,How could you go from Dad to that? Aren't you ashamed?
846,I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!
847,Go run to your fucking kike!
848,Run to him!
849,It's OK.
850,"I'm proud of you, baby."
851,"I'm so sorry, Doris."
852,I really am.
853,He's gone.
854,He's just a boy without a father.
855,"Doris, you don't know the world your children are living in."
856,Goodbye.
857,"Hey, you all right?"
858," Take this, you fucking dick!"
859, No. Come here.
860, Fuck you!
861, Calm down.
862, Let go of me!
863, Calm down.
864,"Let me go, God damn it!"
865, Fuck you!
866, I'm sorry.
867,I would never hurt you.
868,You know that.
869,I screwed up. I lost control.
870,It's not you.
871,I'm sorry.
872,I'd never hurt you guys.
873,You know that.
874,I'd do anything for you.
875,I don't believe you.
876,"I trust you, Derek."
877,What are you doing out of bed?
878,Want a plane ride?
879, Yeah.
880, Going for takeoff.
881,"Oh, no, don't crash."
882,Better go to Mom.
883,She's a crazy flier.
884,"Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah."
885, You don't feel too hot.
886, No. It's my chest.
887, What are you up to?
888, I'm just thinking.
889,Yeah? There's a lot of that going around.
890,I don't even know how we got here sometimes.
891,"I feel like I let you down, only I didn't know when it happened."
892,"Mom, it's OK."
893,It's cold in here.
894,No wonder you're sick.
895,You don't get sick from cold.
896,You get sick from germs.
897,No. You get sick from smoking.
898,You ought to quit.
899,It's not good for you.
900,What are you looking at me like that for?
901,When are you going to let that beautiful hair grow back?
902,The day you quit smoking.
903,Deal.
904,I'd better get Ally to bed.
905,You say good night to Mom?
906,Then you have to go to bed.
907,Come on.
908," Good night, Mama."
909," Good night, baby."
910,I go back to that night again and again in my mind.
911,I try to stop it from happening.
912,I want you out of this house.
913,That's fine.
914,I'll be gone in the morning.
915,He can move in with me.
916,"In my mind, I imagine what would've happened..."
917,if I hadn't gone to that room and told him.
918,Get down!
919,"No, Derek!"
920,"Help, Mommy!"
921,"Nigger, you just fucked with the wrong bull. Come here!"
922,Damn!
923,Should've learned your place on the fucking basketball court...
924,but you fucking monkeys never get the message!
925,"My father gave me that truck, you motherfucker!"
926,You ever shoot at firemen?
927,You shoot at my family?
928,"I'm going to teach you a real lesson now, motherfucker."
929,Put your fucking mouth on the curb.
930,"Hold on, man."
931,Put it on the curb right now!
932,That's it.
933,"Derek, no!"
934,Now say good night.
935,Fucker.
936,Drop your weapon!
937,Put your weapon on the ground!
938,Put your hands up!
939,I said get your hands up!
940,Now turn around!
941,Put your hands behind your head!
942,Get down on your knees right now!
943,It's all right.
944,Let's go.
945, Come on.
946, No.
947,She ain't gonna open the door?
948,Someone right fucking there looking at us. Hello?
949,"Danny, it's for you."
950,Be right there.
951,"Open the door, Danny."
952,It's fucking freezing!
953,"Danny, I'm gonna be sick!"
954,"Come on, Danny!"
955,I'm gonna go get some beers.
956,"Hey, what a party, fatso?"
957,"I'm not fat, asshole!"
958,I'm husky!
959,"What the fuck's up, Seth?"
960,"Drink up, Danny, before your brother sees you."
961,"Holy fuck, he's here!"
962,"Yeah, he's fucking here."
963,Go pay your respects.
964,"Fuck you, Seth!"
965,"Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny."
966, Father Vinyard?
967, How's it going?
968,"I'm Jason, this is Chris."
969,We're friends with your brother.
970,"You are a fucking god, man!"
971,I thought you turned that paper in.
972,I did. Now fucking Murray turned me in...
973,so Sweeney's making me write another one.
974,Good old Sweeney.
975,He never stops trying.
976,"He's one of those ""proud to be nigger"" people."
977,I hate those guys.
978,"Wait a minute, Danny."
979,He's not proud.
980,"No. He's a manipulative, selfrighteous Uncle Tom."
981,He's making you feel guilty about writing on Adolf Hitler.
982,"Some nigger, some spic writes about Martin Luther King..."
983,or fucking Cesar commie Chavez gets a pat on the head.
984,Yeah.
985,"You can see the hypocrisy in that, can't you?"
986,Definitely.
987,"Come on, let's go."
988,No. Listen. Wait.
989,"I want to see you, OK?"
990,"I do, but I gotta take care of something tonight."
991, OK.
992, You understand?
993,Yeah. I'm here.
994,"When you're ready, I'm here."
995, Would you do something with me?
996, Anything.
997,Leave with me.
998,Leave where?
999,Leave here. Leave all this.
1000,Just come with me.
1001,Why would you want to leave?
1002,They worship you.
1003,You're like a god to them.
1004,"If we had it good before, wait till you see what it's like now."
1005,I don't want all that.
1006,I don't want my family involved.
1007,"Everything I've done here fucked it all up, understand?"
1008,You think what you did was wrong?
1009,"Oh, baby. Oh, come on."
1010,Those niggers got exactly what they deserved...
1011,and we all know that.
1012,"I understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you."
1013,No one can touch you.
1014,There's a small army out there.
1015,We're not gonna let a bunch of spooks kick us out.
1016,You're not listening to me.
1017,I'm not scared.
1018,I don't want it anymore.
1019,I'm done with it.
1020,I'm through with this.
1021,"It's bullshit, Stacey."
1022,"You don't need this, Stacey."
1023,"Come on, trust me."
1024,"If you want to be with me, just trust me. Come with me."
1025,Come on.
1026,You're nuts. You are nuts.
1027,No way.
1028,I don't think you realize what's been going on here.
1029,"We are 10 times what we were, and we are bloody organized."
1030,It is like nothing you have ever seen.
1031,This was a mistake. Forget it.
1032,Wait a second.
1033,What was a mistake?
1034,"Stacey, just say goodbye."
1035,This isn't you. I know you.
1036,"You don't know anything about me, Stacey."
1037, Are you Danny's brother?
1038, Yeah.
1039,Will you tell him Lizzy's looking for him?
1040,Thank you.
1041,"We'll let the niggers, kikes, and spics grab for the pie."
1042,Can't blame 'em.
1043,"Course, they're gonna have to fight to get it."
1044,And if we scare the fuck out of people...
1045,"and a few people get killed in the process, so be it."
1046,"Gonna put that in your paper, Danny?"
1047,"Hey, man."
1048,"Well, look who's here."
1049,The return of the soldier.
1050,"What are you doing here, Danny?"
1051,"Come on, man."
1052,I had to check it out.
1053,You knew I was gonna come.
1054,"Let the kid alone, Derek."
1055,He knows when to go to bed.
1056,Go wait outside.
1057,"Come on, Der."
1058,I'm not doing anything.
1059,This little blonde girl keeps asking for you.
1060,She's dying. Come on.
1061, I gotta check out.
1062, Go easy on her.
1063,All right.
1064,Wait for me right outside.
1065,Take it easy.
1066,Chill out.
1067,You're on safe ground.
1068,You don't have to watch your ass around here.
1069,Come on. Sit down. Relax.
1070,I'm sorry.
1071,The party was a little quick...
1072,"but we're just so damn glad you're back, Derek."
1073,It's only natural you should feel a little funny.
1074,"I don't feel funny, Cam."
1075,You made the fat kid a little nervous.
1076,He thinks the joint messed with your mind.
1077,It did.
1078,"Glory, glory, hallelujah..."
1079,The white man marches on!
1080,Things have changed since you've been gone.
1081,You talk about organization?
1082,Wait'll you see what we've done with the internet.
1083,We've got every gang from Seattle to San Diego...
1084,working together now.
1085,Not competing anymore.
1086,They're consolidated.

1237,so I figured I'd put up a flag and hope a friend sees it.
1238,That's the cat I'm talking about right there.
1239,Boss.
1240,Have a seat.
1241,It's a pleasure.
1242,"Don't fuck with me, all right?"
1243,'Cause I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.
1244,You know why?
1245,'Cause I control the underwear.
1246,"We pick 'em up over here, and we store 'em over there."
1247,"And I hope you work out, all right?"
1248,'Cause the last guy they sent me didn't wear no drawers...
1249,couldn't read the sizes in the drawers...
1250,"and used to sniff the drawers, all right?"
1251,"We got two sizesmedium and large, all right?"
1252,All you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums...
1253,"and the larges with the larges, all right?"
1254,I know it's a boring job...
1255,but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
1256,I spent two years in the kitchen scrubbing hotass pots and pans.
1257,"That you don't wanna do, all right?"
1258,You should be happy as shit you landed this job.
1259,There's no telling what they'd have you do up in the joint.
1260,By the way...
1261,what you in for?
1262,"Probably robbed some old lady, huh?"
1263,"OK, I know your kind, right?"
1264,Badass peckerwood with an attitude.
1265,"Let me tell you something, man, you better watch your ass..."
1266,"'cause in the joint, you the nigger, not me."
1267,I was a year in.
1268,I thought I was cruising.
1269,Then everything started getting complicated.
1270,What the fuck is that?
1271,What's that all about?
1272,"That's just politics, man."
1273,"Favors, you know?"
1274,He's doing favors for that fucking spic?
1275,Mitch has just got a little something extra...
1276,"on the side with them boys, you know?"
1277,"You're kidding, right?"
1278,No.
1279,"That's bullshit, man."
1280,Somebody should say something to him.
1281,What the fuck is he thinking?
1282,Mitch is the only reason you're not a corpse right now.
1283,You know what?
1284,I don't fucking give a shit.
1285,I can take care of myself.
1286,He shouldn't be doing that.
1287,"I'm getting sick of it, man."
1288,There's a lot of hard talk here and no followthrough.
1289,I think you better chill out on the preaching bullshit.
1290,We're getting a little tired of that shit around here.
1291,Ease up on it.
1292,"What are you doing here, Doris?"
1293,I was in the neighborhood.
1294,"Look, I told you I don't want you all coming up here."
1295,"I don't care what you told me, OK?"
1296,I need to talk to you now.
1297,"So, how is everyone?"
1298,Davina's great. She's getting straight As almost.
1299,"And Ally's walking, starting to talk a little."
1300,How's Danny?
1301,He holds you up so high.
1302,He thinks you're the greatest.
1303,He's always bragging about you to Cameron...
1304,and all his new friends.
1305,He's starting to remind me of you.
1306,"Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?"
1307,I'm sure he's fine.
1308,"He's 16 years old, Doris."
1309,He's not gonna be a little angel forever.
1310,You think because I watched my firstborn...
1311,fuck up his entire life that I can sit here...
1312,and see my baby follow him down the same toilet?
1313,I can't fix all this shit from up here.
1314,I'm not asking you to.
1315,All it does is make me feel bad.
1316,You're just making it harder.
1317,"You think you're the only one doing time, Derek?"
1318,You think you're here all alone?
1319,You think I'm not in here with you?
1320,"Fuck, man."
1321,Every day I watch you go through these sheets...
1322,like you gonna get to the end of them.
1323,"Look, nigger, will you chill the fuck out?"
1324,Goddamn!
1325,No matter how fast you get through them...
1326,they gonna keep bringing them in and bringing them in.
1327,Throwing them around like that...
1328,ain't gonna do a damn thing but give you a heart attack!
1329,And you know what?
1330,That's cool with me!
1331,"But you gonna give me a goddamn heart attack, too!"
1332,"I know, I'm just a dumb, stupid nigger, right?"
1333,What do I know?
1334,"I know I ain't the one getting mad at them sheets, though."
1335,"As a matter of fact, the only sheets I get mad at..."
1336,I'll tell you.
1337,"All right, boy, this is what we gonna do."
1338,We gonna hate some niggers.
1339,That's what we'll do today.
1340,We gonna hate some goddamn niggers.
1341,That's all we gonna do is hate some niggers all day.
1342,"Don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them."
1343,My cousin Derek is in the pen right now...
1344,"working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy."
1345,See? That's the ticket.
1346,Nice and easy.
1347,Now we can ignore each other in peace.
1348,"""What are you doing?"" You know what he tells me?"
1349,"""It's better than the pig I just tried to fuck."" He never lets me finish the joke."
1350,"You fuck him, too?"
1351,"Whatever. She's laying on her back, her legs are open..."
1352,What's up? How you doing?
1353,There you go.
1354,He was taking it from the Mexicans...
1355,and dealing it out to his own people.
1356,He didn't believe in shit.
1357,None of them did.
1358,"What? Come on, man."
1359,Don't look at me like that.
1360,You know what that smells like.
1361,Don't tell me this smell don't remind you of a woman.
1362,"God, I miss that smell, man."
1363,The job I had on the outside wasn't much better than this...
1364,but at least I got to go home every night...
1365,"and lie down next to that sweet smell, man."
1366,"God, I miss that."
1367,You got a woman?
1368,"Yeah, you got a woman, man."
1369,"Let me give you some advice, all right?"
1370,When she comes to visit you...
1371,"whatever you do, no matter what..."
1372,"don't let her leave here in a fight, man."
1373,Don't let her walk out with a bad attitude...
1374,"'cause if you do, you spend the next week..."
1375,wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else...
1376,you know what I'm saying?
1377,"So when she come to see you, it's nothing but sweet talk."
1378,"Send her away floating, all right?"
1379,'Cause it's not like the real world where you can fight...
1380,'cause you can make up and have that makeup sex.
1381,Know what I'm saying?
1382,That angry sex.
1383,That sex with an attitude.
1384,You lay on your back and let her take out that aggression on you.
1385,"All guys know that, man."
1386,That's that good sex.
1387,"That's that pow, pow, pow."
1388,"Let her get on top, and she'll punish you first."
1389,"""You been a bad boy, huh?"
1390,"""You been a bad boy, and I'm gonna punish you."
1391,"""I'm gonna put it on you."
1392,"""Don't you ever..."
1393,let... me... catch... you...
1394,"""looking at... another... woman."
1395,"Yeah, yeah."
1396,"""I may forgive you if you bring it."
1397,"""I think I can. II forgive."
1398,"""I forgive. Right there."
1399,You're hitting it.
1400,"""My spot. That's it. Right."
1401,"""Yes. I forI forgive you."
1402,I forgive you.
1403,"""I forI for I forI forgive you!"
1404,"""I love you!"" How do you figure the Lakers to ever be a bigger dynasty..."
1405,than the Celtics?
1406,"The Lakers are a flareup, a fluke."
1407,Are you crazy?
1408,One good coach for four years.
1409,The Celtics are a dynasty!
1410,"Come on, man."
1411,"The Celtics, right?"
1412,The ugliest team in the history of sports.
1413,"A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man."
1414,Look at Kevin McHale.
1415,James Worthy. That guy has a head like a melon.
1416,He had ladies.
1417,I can't even talk to you.
1418,I don't know what you're saying.
1419,You are tweaking.
1420,Boston Celtics.
1421, How many is that?
1422, That's enough.
1423,Enough? All right.
1424,You got that?
1425," I lost count, man."
1426," Doesn't matter, man."
1427,Who's counting anyway?
1428,"All right, so I wanna know something."
1429,What the fuck landed you in here?
1430,"You didn't kill anybody, too skinny for a gangbanger."
1431,Ain't that a bitch?
1432,Don't judge a book by its cover.
1433,I can throw these things.
1434,Whatever. Come on.
1435,What did you do?
1436,None of your business.
1437,It's embarrassing.
1438,It's none of your goddamn business.
1439,Come on. Everybody in here is embarrassed.
1440,Nobody in here got away with anything.
1441,What'd you do?
1442,"Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?"
1443,So you stole a TV.
1444,What's embarrassing about that?
1445,I stole a TV from a store next to a doughnut shop.
1446,"I ran out, the owner's right behind me yelling."
1447,Bam! I run into three cops.
1448,I told you it was embarrassing.
1449,You're laughing.
1450,"Wait a sec, wait a sec."
1451,That don't make sense.
1452,"Nah, you didn't get six years for stealing a TV. Come on."
1453,"I come out, the police officer grabs my arm..."
1454,the TV falls on his foot and breaks it.
1455,They said I threw the TV at him.
1456,Assault. Six years.
1457,Come on. Tell the truth.
1458,You chucked it at him.
1459,"Like I said, I came out of the store..."
1460,"he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot."
1461,Come on now.
1462,"What you got for me, huh?"
1463,"There you go, baby!"
1464,Yeah!
1465,That's what I'm talking about.
1466,Fuck you!
1467,Give me a towel. Hold him.
1468,"You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?"
1469, Fuck you!
1470, We gonna treat you like one.
1471, No.
1472, Come on.
1473,"Come on, give it to him!"
1474,Fuck you!
1475,That was real sweet.
1476,Fuck you!
1477,How is he?
1478,"Well, he took six stitches."
1479,"Man, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?"
1480,"I came to talk about Danny, but we don't have to do that now."
1481,I brought you some books.
1482,"What about him, you know?"
1483,Don't keep me in suspense.
1484,He's headed right where you are.
1485,You know what? My mother already laid this trip on me.
1486,Danny's not my responsibility.
1487,What do you expect me to do with that?
1488,It doesn't help me.
1489,Am I supposed to feel guilty?
1490,I don't want you to do anything.
1491,I need to know the truth about how you feel.
1492,You think I want him in here?
1493,I mean... I don't know.
1494,I don't know what I feel.
1495,I'm all...
1496,I feel a little inside out.
1497,"I'm, you knowI don't know."
1498,There's some things that... that don't fit.
1499,"Well, that happens."
1500,You are too damn smart to be floating around here...
1501,pretending you don't see all the holes in this bullshit.
1502,"Hey, listen."
1503,I said I was confused.
1504,I didn't say I didn't believe in it.
1505,All right. That's why you have to stay open.
1506,"Right now, your anger is consuming you here."
1507,Your anger is shutting down the brain God gave you.
1508,"God. You know, man?"
1509,You've been talking about...
1510,what's going on with me since I was in high school.
1511,How the fuck do you know what's going on inside me?
1512,"No, I know about me."
1513,I know about this place.
1514,I know about the place you are in.
1515,What do you know about the place I'm in?
1516,There was a moment...
1517,when I used to blame everything and everyone...
1518,for all the pain and suffering...
1519,and vile things that happened to me...
1520,that I saw happen to my people.
1521,Used to blame everybody.
1522,"Blamed white people, blamed society, blamed God."
1523,I didn't get no answers 'cause I asked the wrong questions.
1524,You have to ask the right question.
1525,Like what?
1526,Has anything you've done made your life better?
1527,"You gotta help me, man."
1528,Just help me.
1529,"Get me out of here, you know?"
1530,I'm up in four months for review.
1531,Put in a word for me.
1532,"I already have. So you're out there, and then what?"
1533,I don't want to fuck up my family anymore.
1534,I'll go as far away as I can get.
1535,That's not good enough.
1536,"You want my help, you gotta do better than that."
1537,My help is not unconditional.
1538,Running just ain't good enough.
1539,Fuck him. Fuck him.
1540,Fuck him.
1541,Let the niggers have him.
1542,"What's up, D?"
1543,What's all that bullshit you pulled in the mess hall?
1544,You out of your fucking mind?
1545,Are you fucking crazy?
1546,"D, look at me, man!"
1547,You can't make it in here on your own.
1548,I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
1549,"There was six of them, and they jumped me."
1550,That won't happen again.
1551,I hope they fucking try.
1552,"Man, I'm not talking about your peckerwood friends!"
1553,They're protecting your stupid ass!
1554,You dissed them in public!
1555,Now you're on your fucking own!
1556,"Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers, all right?"
1557,"They'll fuck you, then smoke your motherfucking ass!"
1558,Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
1559,You think I haven't thought about that?
1560,"If they come for me, they come."
1561,There ain't nothing I can do.
1562,"What can I do, man?"
1563,So I was right back where I started.
1564,Every day I was sure it was my day.
1565,Every time I stepped out of my cell...
1566,every time I got in that shower...
1567,I figured it was only a matter of time...
1568,before they made a move.
1569,I just hoped it'd be quick.
1570,But it never came.
1571,I couldn't figure it out.
1572,I knew some of them were itching for it.
1573,"After awhile, I just put my head down..."
1574,and read the stuff that Sweeney sent me...
1575,and I kept to myself.
1576,"Last six months in that place, I was like a ghost."
1577,"What's up, man?"
1578,You getting out?
1579,"Come on, man."
1580,What the fuck you waiting on?
1581,"Get the fuck on outta here, man."
1582,"Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling."
1583,"Oh, yeah? What's that?"
1584,I'm thinking maybe the only reason...
1585,I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.
1586,"Come on, man!"
1587,Get the fuck outta here!
1588,You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line...
1589,for some crazy ass peckerwood?
1590,Yeah. Right.
1591,Stupid.
1592,That's what I thought.
1593,"I owe you, man."
1594,"Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?"
1595,"Yes, I do."
1596,You'll be outta here in no time.
1597,"Man, it's a piece of cake, all right?"
1598,"Just take it easy on the brothers, all right?"
1599,The brothers!
1600,"God, man."
1601,"Sorry, Derek."
1602,Sorry that happened to you.
1603,"Well, I'm not. I'm lucky."
1604,"I feel lucky, 'cause it's wrong, Dan."
1605,"It's wrong, and it was eating me up."
1606,It was gonna kill me.
1607,And I kept asking myself all the time...
1608,"how did I buy into this shit, you know?"
1609,It's just 'cause I was pissed off.
1610,Nothing I ever did ever took that feeling away.
1611,"I killed two guys, Danny."
1612,I killed them.
1613,And it didn't make me feel any different.
1614,Just got me more lost...
1615,"and I'm tired of feeling pissedoff, Danny."
1616,I'm just tired of it.
1617,And I'm not telling you what to do.
1618,I'm really not.
1619,But I need you to understand...
1620,"'cause I love you, and you're my best friend."
1621,Do you understand?
1622,"Yeah, I understand."
1623,All right.
1624,Jesus.
1625,Hi. Everything OK?
1626,"Ah, everything's great."
1627,Great. Yeah.
1628,You wanna sleep in our room?
1629, No. Thank you.
1630, You sure?
1631,Yeah. This is good.
1632,Thank you.
1633,"All right. Come on, let's go."
1634,Good night.
1635,"I'm gonna take a shower, all right?"
1636,It's hard to look back...
1637,and see the truth about people you love.
1638,I think if you asked Derek why it all went the way it did...
1639,and where it all started...
1640,he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.
1641,"The truth is, it started earlier."
1642,Are we all meeting for the game tonight?
1643,Definitely.
1644,"All right, Ben's Burger at 7:00..."
1645,then we go watch the big guy play.
1646,Psyching up for the game?
1647,I'm always ready for that.
1648,I got an English exam.
1649,I'm having a heart attack.
1650,I'm not ready.
1651,What's the matter?
1652,"Afraid you'll get a ""B""?"
1653,Might do you good. Bminus.
1654,"Hey, don't laugh."
1655,This guy is different.
1656,Dr. Sweeney.
1657,This guy's unbelievable.
1658,Unbelievable. I've never had a teacher like this.
1659,He's got two Ph. D.s.
1660,I don't know what he's doing teaching at our school.
1661,What's he got you reading?
1662,"We got this essay exam on ""Native Son."" ""Native Son""?"
1663,I don't know that.
1664,That's a big surprise.
1665,What? I read.
1666,"Honey, they don't teach Tom Clancy in school."
1667,"Well, they don't."
1668,"So what is this ""Native Son""?"
1669,It's this book about this black guy.
1670,We're doing this whole black literature unit.
1671,Is it Black History Month?
1672,"No, it's just this guy Sweeney, you know?"
1673,It's part of the course now.
1674,What?
1675,Nothing. It's just...
1676,It's everywhere I look now.
1677,What?
1678,This affirmative blacktion.
1679,A few new books doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.
1680,"Read the book, ace the guy's test."
1681,Just don't swallow everything he feeds you whole.
1682,Just 'cause you see it on the evening news...
1683,"I know, but what?"
1684,All this stuff about making everything equal.
1685,It's not that simple.
1686,"Now you got this book ""Native Son."" What happened to the other books in the course?"
1687,They're not any good anymore because Mr. Two PhD. says so?
1688,Now you gotta trade in great books for black books?
1689,Does that make sense?
1690,"You gotta question these things, Derek."
1691,You gotta look at the whole picture.
1692,We're talking about books here.
1693,I'm also talking about my job.
1694,I got two black guys on my squad now...
1695,who got their job over a couple of white guys...
1696,who actually scored higher on the test.
1697,Does that make sense?
1698,"Everything's equal now, but I got two guys watching my back..."
1699,responsible for my life who aren't as good.
1700,They only got the job because they were black...
1701,not because they were the best.
1702, That sucks.
1703, Is that what America's about?
1704,"No, America's about best man for the job."
1705,"You do your best, you get the job."
1706,This affirmativeaction crap...
1707,I don't know what that's about.
1708,There's like some hidden agenda or something going on.
1709,You see what I'm saying?
1710,"Yeah, I do. I didn't think about it like that."
1711,"This guy, thoughI don't know."
1712,"Dr. Sweeney, he comes on so strong..."
1713,it's hard not to listen to him...
1714,but maybe some of what he says is kinda...
1715,It's bullshit.
1716,"Yeah. Yeah, maybe."
1717,No. It's nigger bullshit.
1718," You see that, don't you?"
1719, Yeah.
1720,You gotta watch out for that.
1721,"Yeah. No, I get what you're saying. I will."
1722,Good boy.
1723,I'm proud of you.
1724,Don't worry about it. I got it.
1725,And in about one minute...
1726,I'm gonna watch the sun come up.
1727,I don't know if I've ever done that.
1728,"Anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over."
1729,"It won't be easy, but we're all together again..."
1730,and I feel good.
1731,I'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted if I hit the social significance...
1732,or whatever you're looking for...
1733,"but for what it's worth, thanks a lot."
1734,Wow. You look great.
1735,Look at you.
1736,Yeah. Gotta dress up for the parole officer.
1737,Is she cute?
1738,She is a fat guy named Hector...
1739, Oh. Well...
1740, So I'm out of luck.
1741,I just gotta check in...
1742,then I'm gonna see about getting my old job back.
1743, Great.
1744, Good morning.
1745,"Davina, can you help?"
1746,Your sister's gonna help you.
1747,You look great. Knock 'em dead.
1748,Thanks.
1749,"Come on, sweetie. What would you like to wear today?"
1750, You do look good.
1751, Yeah? I feel silly.
1752, You look good.
1753, Yeah?
1754,You feel good?
1755,"Yeah. I feel, you know..."
1756,a little...
1757,I'm getting there.
1758,Listen... I don't know I don't know if it's OK that I'm here.
1759,I want to be here.
1760, I'm gonna get a paper.
1761, Cool.
1762, What do you want?
1763, Maple bar and a large milk.
1764,All right. I got it.
1765,Let me get a coffee...
1766,"a maple bar, and a large milk to go."
1767,Right away.
1768,"Derek, we need to talk."
1769,What's going on?
1770,Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan are at the ICU at St. John's.
1771,They were jumped last night near Ben's Burgers.
1772,How bad?
1773,"Well, it looks like they're gonna live."
1774, Then they got lucky.
1775," Somebody's gotta lose, though."
1776,What?
1777,We were kinda hoping maybe you'd talk to your old crew Come on. No way.
1778,"If there's anybody they're gonna listen to, it's you."
1779,"No. I hate to tell you, but I'm out, OK?"
1780,Those guys are probably gunning for me now.
1781,"We're asking for your help here, Derek."
1782,Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
1783,This has got nothing to do with me anymore.
1784,"Yes, it does. It has everything to do with you."
1785,"God, what are you doing to me?"
1786,I'm doing my best!
1787,I'm going like this just to keep my family in the clear.
1788,Don't ask me to fix this fucking situation!
1789, I'm not asking that.
1790, It was there before me.
1791,You helped create it.
1792,You wanna take a break now?
1793,"You take a break, you'll find no peace."
1794,The way to find peace is to stick.
1795,It's not gonna make a fucking bit of difference.
1796, It might.
1797, Not a bit.
1798,"I mean, do you know what you're asking me to do?"
1799,Yes. I'm asking you to do whatever's in your power to do.
1800,"Oh, man."
1801,Fuck.
1802,All right.
1803,You know what you're gonna do?
1804,Get me shot by white boys.
1805,I doubt it.
1806,"We're all gonna have a laugh at that, let me tell ya."
1807,I'm gonna take him to school.
1808,I'll be back in half an hour.
1809,Come on.
1810,"Hey, you. You got something good for me this morning?"
1811,"I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney."
1812," Yeah, OK."
1813, All right.
1814,What's going on?
1815,"Come on, let's go."
1816,"It's just so bad for Seth, man."
1817,I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
1818,I'm glad they're not dead.
1819,"Other than that, I don't care."
1820,Should we visit them?
1821,No. Definitely not.
1822,Just stay out of it.
1823,Listen. I saw a car cruising by the house last night...
1824,when I pulled out of there with Seth.
1825,"If you get home before me today, give a look around the street."
1826,Make sure there's nothing going on.
1827,"Man, this is bad."
1828," They're after you, man."
1829, It'll cool off.
1830,"If I made it through Chino, this should be a piece of cake."
1831,You gonna be OK?
1832,What are you gonna do?
1833,I'll work it out.
1834,"Keep your head up, all right?"
1835,Things are gonna be fine.
1836,It's gonna be fine.
1837,Go turn that paper in.
1838,All right. See ya.
1839,Come here.
1840,I'll see you at home.

1842,"Yeah, I'll see you."
1843,"Good luck, all right?"
1844, Yeah.

1846, Gonna be late.
1847, We better go.

1849,Bye.
1850,I'll catch up with you.
1851,See you later.
1852,Get out of my way!
1853,All right! Let him go!
1854,"Oh, no."
1855,"Aw, Jesus."
1856,"Oh, Jesus."
1857,"God, what did I do?"
1858,So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned.
1859,"My conclusion, right?"
1860,"Well, my conclusion is hate is baggage."
1861,Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.
1862,It's just not worth it.
1863,Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
1864,He says someone else has already said it best...
1865,so if you can't top it...
1866,steal from them and go out strong.
1867,So I picked a guy I thought you'd like.
1868,"""We are not enemies, but friends."
1869,"""We must not be enemies."
1870,"""Though passion may have strained..."
1871,"""we must not break our bonds of affection."
1872,"""The mystic chords of memory..."
1873,"""will swell when again touched..."
1874,"""as surely they will be..."
