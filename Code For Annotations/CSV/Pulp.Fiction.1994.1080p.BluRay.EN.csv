0,Forget it. It's too risky.
1,I'm through doing that shit.
2,You always say that.
3,The same thing every time.
4,"""I'm through, never again, too dangerous."" I know that's what I always say."
5,I'm always right too.
6,You forget about it in a day or two.
7,The days of me forgetting are over.
8,The days of me remembering have just begun.
9,"You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like?"
10,I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
11,You sound like a duck.
12,"Quack, quack, quack."
13,"Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again."
14,"Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack."
15,After tonight?
16,Correct.
17,I got all tonight to quack.
18,Can I get anyone more coffee?
19,"Oh, yes!"
20,Thank you.
21,You're welcome.
22,"I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank."
23,Takin' more of a risk.
24,Banks are easier.
25,Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.
26,They're insured. Why should they give a fuck? I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
27,"Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone."
28,He gives the phone to a teller.
29,"The bloke on the other end says, ""We got this guy's little girl."
30,"If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."" Did it work?"
31,Fuckin' right it worked.
32,That's what I'm talkin' about.
33,"Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone."
34,Cleans the place out.
35,They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
36,Did they hurt the little girl?
37,There probably never was a little girl.
38,The point of the story isn't a little girl.
39,The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.
40,You want to rob banks?
41,I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
42,"I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing."
43,No more liquor stores?
44,What've we been talkin' about?
45,"Yeah, no more liquor stores."
46,"Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be."
47,There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.
48,"Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English."
49,"You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about."
50,They make it too personal.
51,"We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him."
52,I'm not gonna kill anybody.
53,I don't want to either.
54,But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.
55,"And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations."
56,You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
57,Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.
58,See how far that gets you.
59,Forget it.
60,We're out of it.
61,"Well, what then, day jobs?"
62,Not in this life.
63,What then?
64,"Gar  on, coffee!"
65,This place.
66,"""Gar  on"" means boy."
67,This place?
68,A coffee shop?
69,What's wrong with that?
70,Nobody ever robs restaurants.
71,Why not?
72,"Bars, liquor stores, gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them."
73,"Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down."
74,They're not expectin' to get robbed.
75,Not as expectin' anyway.
76,I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.
77,Correct.
78,"Same as banks, these places are insured."
79,Manager.
80,He don't give a fuck.
81,They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.
82,Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
83,No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.
84,Busboys. Some wetback gettin' paid $1.50 an hour...
85,really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner?
86,"Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on."
87,"One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face."
88,"See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember?"
89,All the customers kept comin' in.
90,Yeah.
91,You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
92,"Now, that was a good idea."
93,Thank you.
94,Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.
95,"Yes, we did."
96,A lot of people come to restaurants.
97,A lot of wallets.
98,"Pretty smart, huh?"
99,Pretty smart.
100,I'm ready. Let's do it.
101,"Right now, right here."
102,Come on.
103,"All right. Same as last time, remember?"
104,You're crowd control.
105,I'll handle the employees.
106,"I love you, pumpkin."
107,"I love you, honey bunny."
108,Everybody be cool!
109,This is a robbery!

116,"I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places."
117,Those are hash bars?
118,Yeah.
119,It breaks down like this.
120,It's legal to buy it.
121,It's legal to own it.

133,It's the little differences.
134,"I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here, but it's just there, it's a little different."
135,Example...
136,You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
137,And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
138,I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
139,"And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's."
140,You know what they call...
141,a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
142,They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
143,They got the metric system.
144,They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarterpounder is.
145,What do they call it?
146,They call it a Royale with Cheese.
147,Royale with Cheese.
148,That's right.
149,What do they call a Big Mac?
150,"Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac."

162,Three or four.
163,That's countin' our guy?
164,Not sure.
165,So that means that it could be up to five guys up there?
166,It's possible.
167,We should have fuckin' shotguns.
168,VINCENT: What's her name?
169,JULES Mia.
170,Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
171,I don't know.
172,However people meet people.
173,She used to be a actress.
174,"Oh, really?"
175,She do anything I'd have seen?
176,I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
177,Pilot? What's a pilot?
178,"Well, you know the shows on TV?"
179,I don't watch TV.
180,"Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television, and on this invention they show shows, right?"
181,Yeah.
182,The way they pick TV shows is they make one show.
183,That show's called a pilot.
184,Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...
185,"and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows."
186,Some get chosen and become television programs.
187,"Some don't, become nothin'."
188,She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
189,You remember Antwan Rockamora?
190,"Halfblack, halfSamoan."
191,"Used to call him ""Tony Rocky Horror."" Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?"
192,I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.
193,He got a weight problem.
194,"I mean, what's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan."
195,I think I know who you mean.
196,What about him?
197,Marsellus fucked him up good.
198,Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
199,ELEVATOR BELL RINGS So what he'd do? Fuck her?
200,"No, no, no, no, no."
201,Nothin' that bad.
202,"Well, then what then?"
203,He gave her a foot massage.
204,A foot massage?
205,That's it?
206,Mmhmm.
207,Then what'd Marsellus do?
208,Sent a couple cats over to his place.
209,They took him out on his patio.
210,Threw his ass over the balcony.
211,Nigger fell four stories.
212,"He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse."
213,Nigger fell through that.
214,"Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment."
215,That's a damn shame.
216,Hmm.
217,"But still, you play with matches, you get burned."
218,What do you mean?
219,You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
220,You don't think he overreacted?
221,"Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction."
222,It was a foot massage.
223,A foot massage is nothin'.
224,I give my mother a foot massage.
225,It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.
226,"I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark."
227,"Whoa whoa whoa whoa, stop right there."
228,Eatin' the bitch out...
229,and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.
230,It's not.
231,It's the same ballpark.
232,Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
233,"Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine."
234,But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...
235,ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
236,Foot massages don't mean shit!
237,Have you ever given a foot massage?
238,SCOFFS Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
239,I'm the foot fuckin' master.
240,You given a lot of them?
241,"Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and everything."
242,I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
243,Would you give a guy a foot massage?
244,Fuck you.
245,CHUCKLES You give 'em a lot?
246,Fuck you.
247,"You know, I'm kind of tired."
248,I could use a foot massage.
249,"Yo, yo, yo, man."
250,You best back off.
251,I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
252,This is the door.
253,"Yeah, it is."
254,What time you got?
255,"No, it ain't quite time yet."
256,Come on. Let's hang back.
257,"Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right..."
258,"for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right."
259,"Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker."
260,"I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothin'."
261,I'm sayin' it does.
262,"Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'."
263,"We act like they don't, but they do."
264,That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
265,There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
266,"where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it."
267,Fuckin' Marsellus knew it.
268,And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.
269,"That's his fuckin' wife, man."
270,This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.
271,You know what I'm sayin'?
272,It's an interestin' point.
273,Come on.
274,Let's get into character.
275,What's her name again?
276,Mia.
277,Mia.
278,Why you so interested in big man's wife?
279,"Well he's goin' out of town, Florida."
280,And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.
281,Take care of her?
282,"No, man. Just take her out."
283,Show her a good time.
284,Make sure she don't get lonely.
285,You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?
286,It is not a date.
287,It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
288,"It's just good company, that's all."
289,SIGHS It's not a date.
290,JULES SCOFFS It's definitely not a date.
291,"JULES SIGHS Hey, kids."

430,"You see, this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers."
431,Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.
432,If you mean it turns to vinegar... it does.

434,"Besides, Butch, how many fights you think you got in you anyway?"
435,Hmm?
436,Two?

679,She was the leader.
680,The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
681,The black girl was a demolition expert.
682,French Fox's speciality was sex.
683,What was your speciality?
684,Knives.
685,"The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she grew up raised by circus performers."
686,"According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife."
687,And she knew a zillion old jokes.
688,"Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her."
689,"And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick..."
690,where every show I would've told another joke.
691,You know any of them old jokes?

720,       CONTINUES Don't you hate that?
721,Hate what?
722,Uncomfortable silences.
723,Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
724,I don't know.
725,That's a good question.
726,That's when you know you found somebody really special.
727,When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.
728,"Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad."
729,We just met each other.
730,I'll tell you what.
731,I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.
732,You sit here...
733,and think of something to say.
734,I'll do that.

742,We're lucky we got anything at all.
743,I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.
744,Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
745,Which one?
746,There's two Monroes.
747,"No, there's not."
748,That is Marilyn Monroe.
749,That is Mamie Van Doren.
750,"I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off."
751,Pretty smart.
752,Yeah. I got my moments.
753,So did you think of somethin' to say?
754,"Actually, I did."
755,However...
756,"you seem like a really nice person, and I    I don't want to offend you."
757,Oooh.
758,"This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'toknowyou chitchat."
759,This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.
760,"Well, well, I do. I do."
761,INHALES But you have to promise not to be offended.
762,"No, no no no."
763,You can't promise somethin' like that.
764,I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
765,"You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended."
766,"Then through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise."
767,Let's just forget it.
768,That's an impossibility.
769,Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
770,Is that a fact?
771,"And besides, isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission?"
772,"All right, all right."
773,"Well, here goes."
774,What did you think about what happened to Antwan?
775,Who's Antwan?
776,Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
777,He fell out of a window.
778,Hmm. Hmm.
779,"Well, that is one way to say it."
780,Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.
781,Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.
782,"Yet, even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you."
783,Is that a fact?
784,No.
785,"No, it's not a fact."
786,It's just what I heard.
787,That's just what I heard.
788,Who told you?
789,They.
790,"""They"" talk a lot, don't they?"
791,CHUCKLES They certainly do.
792,They certainly do.
793,"Don't be shy, Vincent."
794,"What else did ""they"" say?"
795,Well I'm    I'm not shy.
796,"Um    Did it involve the ""F"" word?"
797,"Nono, no, no, no, no."
798,They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.
799,And?
800,And    And nothin'.
801,That's it.
802,You heard Marsellus...
803,threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourthstory window for giving me a foot massage?
804,Mmhmm.
805,And you believe that?
806,"CHUCKLES Well, I mean, the time I was told it sounded reasonable."
807,Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourthstory window...
808,for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
809,"No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen."
810,I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.
811,A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.
812,A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
813,But did it happen?
814,Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it...
815,at my wedding.
816,Really?
817,"Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window..."
818,except Marsellus and Tony.
819,"When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle."

1067,"Hello, little man."
1068,"Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you."
1069,"See, I was a good friend of your dad's."
1070,We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together...
1071,over five years.
1072,Hopefully...
1073,"you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were..."
1074,"for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other."
1075,"If it'd been me who'd    not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim."
1076,"But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you."
1077,Butch...
1078,I got something for ya.
1079,This watch I got here...
1080,was first purchased by your greatgrandfather during the First World War.
1081,"It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee."
1082,Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.
1083,"Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches."
1084,It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
1085,on the day he set sail for Paris.
1086,"This was your greatgrandfather's war watch, and he wore it every day he was in that war, and..."
1087,"when he'd done his duty, he went home to your greatgrandmother, took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed..."
1088,"until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country..."
1089,to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.
1090,This time they called it World War II.
1091,Your greatgrandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.
1092,"Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's."
1093,"Dane was a Marine, and he was killed, along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island."
1094,Your granddad was facing death.
1095,He knew it.
1096,"None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive, so three days before the Japanese took the island, your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki    a man he'd never met before in his life    to deliver to his infant son, who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch."
1097,"Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word."
1098,"After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch."
1099,This watch.
1100,This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.
1101,"He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp."
1102,"He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch, it'd be confiscated, taken away."
1103,"The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright."
1104,"He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright, so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something    his ass."
1105,Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.
1106,Then he died of dysentery    He give me the watch.
1107,"I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass, two years."
1108,Then...
1109,"after seven years, I was sent home to my family and..."
1110,now...
1111,"little man, I give the watch to you."

1760,"Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!"
1761,Shit!
1762,What you doing?
1763,I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
1764,Where's Toluca Lake?
1765,"Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios."
1766,"If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do, 'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818."
1767,"Jimmie, how you doin', man?"
1768,"It's Jules. Just listen up, man."
1769,"Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto."
1770,I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
1771,JULES We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.
1772,He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
1773,"VINCENT If he does, what do we do?"
1774,"Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls, but I don't want it to reach that pitch    Jimmie's a friend."
1775,You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.
1776,Just tell him not to be abusive.
1777,He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
1778,"Put yourself in his position    It's 8o'clock in the morning, he just woke up."
1779,He wasn't expectin' this shit.
1780,We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.
1781,"If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass."
1782,"Hey fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man?"
1783,I was dryin' my hands!
1784,Well you're supposed to wash 'em first!
1785,Well you watched me wash 'em.
1786,I watched you get 'em wet.
1787,I was washin' 'em.
1788,This shit's hard to get off.
1789,Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.
1790,"I used the same fuckin' soap you did, and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxipad!"
1791,What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?
1792,"It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man!"
1793,"Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right?"
1794,You know I respect you and all.
1795,"But just don't put me in this position, all right?"
1796,All right.
1797,Fine. Fine.
1798,"Ask me nice like that, no problem."
1799,Just go handle your friend.
1800,Go ahead. I don't care.
1801,Mmm!
1802,"Goddamn, Jimmie!"
1803,This some serious gourmet shit.
1804,Me and Vincent would've been satisfied...
1805,with some freezedried Taster's Choice.
1806,Right?
1807,CHUCKLES And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.
1808,What flavor is this?
1809,"Knock it off, Julie."
1810,What?
1811,I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.
1812,I'm the one who buys it.
1813,I know how good it is.
1814,"When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit."
1815,"I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it."
1816,But you know what's on my mind right now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
1817,It's the dead nigger in my garage.
1818,"Jimmie, don't even worry    No no no don't tell me about anything."
1819,I wanna ask you a question.
1820,"When you came pulling in here, did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, ""Dead nigger storage""?"
1821,You know I ain't seen no    Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...
1822,"that said, ""Dead nigger storage""?"
1823,No. I didn't.
1824,You know why you didn't see that sign?
1825,SIGHS Why?
1826,"'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!"
1827,"Hey Jimmie we're not gonna store the motherfucker    No no no no no no, don't you fuckin' realize..."
1828,"that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?"
1829,No marriage counselor.
1830,No trial separation.
1831,I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
1832,Okay? And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!
1833,"Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it."
1834,"Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you."
1835,"Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me, Jules! Okay?"
1836,"Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me."
1837,There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Is there?
1838,"Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half."
1839,The graveyard shift at the hospital.
1840,You gotta make some phone calls?
1841,You gotta call some people?
1842,"Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here."
1843,That's Kool and the Gang.
1844,We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
1845,All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.
1846,You're fucking my shit up right now!
1847,You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.
1848,"So just do me that favor, all right?"
1849,The phone is in my bedroom.
1850,I suggest you get going.
1851,"Well, say she comes home."
1852,What do you think she'll do?
1853,"Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak."
1854,That ain't no kinda answer.
1855,"I mean, you know, I don't."
1856,How much? A lot or a little?
1857,You got to appreciate what an explosive element...
1858,this Bonnie situation is.
1859,"She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen..."
1860,"doing a bunch of gangster shit, there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do."
1861,"ALL GASPING Yeah, I grasp that, Jules."
1862,All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.
1863,I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs!
1864,"All I want to hear from your ass is, ""You ain't got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker."
1865,"Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly."" You ain't got no problem, Jules."
1866,I'm on the motherfucker.
1867,"Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly."
1868,You sendin' the Wolf?
1869,"Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?"
1870,"Shit, yeah, negro!"
1871,That's all you had to say!
1872,       PIANO THE WOLF She the hysterical type?
1873,When is she due?
1874,PARTYGOERS CHATTERING Mmhmm.
1875,Give me the principals' names again.
1876,MAN Place your bets.
1877,Jules. Mmhmm.
1878,"Cards, please."
1879,Vincent.
1880,Jimmie.
1881,Bonnie. Mmhmm.
1882,It's 30 minutes away.
1883,I'll be there in 10.
1884,"TIRES SCREECHING DOORBELL RINGS You're... Jimmie, right?"
1885,This is your house?
1886,It sure is.
1887,I'm Winston Wolf.
1888,I solve problems.
1889,Good. We got one.
1890,May I come in?
1891,"Uh, yeah. Please do."
1892,You must be Jules.
1893,Which would make you... Vincent.
1894,"Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen."
1895,"If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking."
1896,"Is that right, Jimmie?"
1897,"Uh, one hundred percent."
1898,"Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?"
1899,Uhhuh.
1900,"I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much."
1901,She wouldn't at that.
1902,"That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty."
1903,"Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it."
1904,SIGHS Jimmie.
1905,Uhhuh.
1906,"Do me a favor, will ya?"
1907,Thought I smelled some coffee back there.
1908,Would you make me a cup?
1909,"Uh, yeah, sure."
1910,"Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?"
1911,"Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar."
1912,"About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall?"
1913,Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?
1914,Is there gas in it?
1915,"Aside from how it looks, the car's cool."
1916,Positive?
1917,Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
1918,"Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tiptop."
1919,Good enough.
1920,Let's go back to the kitchen.
1921,"EXHALES Here you go, Mr. Wolf."
1922,"Thank you, Jimmie."
1923,Mmm.
1924,"Okay, first thing."
1925,You two.
1926,"Take the body, stick it in the trunk."
1927,"Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house that would lead me to believe in the garage or under the sink you got a bunch of cleaners or cleansers or shit like that."
1928,"Yeah yeah Mr. Wolf, under the sink."
1929,Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...
1930,"and clean the inside of the car    I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast."
1931,"You need to go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull."
1932,Get it out of there.
1933,Wipe down the upholstery.
1934,It don't need to be spickandspan.
1935,You don't need to eat off it.
1936,Just give it a good onceover.
1937,What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
1938,"The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up."
1939,"Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet."
1940,"I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads."
1941,"The thicker the better, the darker the better."
1942,No whites. Can't use 'em.
1943,We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and back seat and floorboards...
1944,"with quilts and blankets, so if a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last, but at a glance the car will appear to be normal."
1945,"Jimmie, lead the way."
1946,"Boys, get to work."
1947,"""Please"" would be nice."
1948,Come again?
1949,"I said, a ""please"" would be nice."
1950,"Get it straight, Buster."
1951,I'm not here to say please.
1952,I'm here to tell you what to do.
1953,"And if selfpreservation is an instinct you possess, you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick."
1954,I'm here to help.
1955,"If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen."
1956,"No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated."
1957,"Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, okay?"
1958,I respect you.
1959,I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
1960,"If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor."
1961,"I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this."
1962,"So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car."
1963,"Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right?"
1964,I can feel your look.
1965,It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
1966,SIPPING Green.
1967,Nothin' except for the mess inside.
1968,"Mmm, about 20 minutes."
1969,Nobody who'll be missed.
1970,"You're a good man, Joe."
1971,Thanks a bunch.
1972,"How we comin', Jimmie?"
1973,"Uh, pretty good."
1974,"I got it all here, but, uh, SIGHS Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something."
1975,"Winston, Jimmie, Winston."
1976,"Okay. You gotta understand something, uh, Winston."
1977,"Uh    Uh, no, thank you."
1978,"Uh, this is our best linen here, and it's, uh    it was a wedding present..."
1979,from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.
1980,They're not with us anymore. And I really wanna help you guys out and all    Let me ask you a question.
1981,If you don't mind.
1982,"No, no, please."
1983,Go ahead.
1984,"Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt ginny, were they millionaires?"
1985,No.
1986,"Well, your Uncle Marsellus is."
1987,And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
1988,Ginny.
1989,"Ginny were here, they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do."
1990,I like oak myself.
1991,That's what I have in my bedroom.
1992,"How about you, Jimmie?"
1993,You an oak man?
1994,Oak's nice.
1995,"Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit."
1996,"This is some fuckedup, repugnant shit."
1997,"Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong, that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?"
1998,Get the fuck out my face with that shit!
1999,The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up ittybitty pieces of skull...
2000,on account of your dumb ass.
2001,"I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take."
2002,"Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red."
2003,I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
2004,That's all. I could blow.
2005,"Oh, oh, you ready to blow?"
2006,Yeah.
2007,"Well, I'm a mushroomcloudlayin' motherfucker, motherfucker."
2008,"Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly T.N.T."
2009,I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
2010,"In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?"
2011,You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail!
2012,We're fuckin' switchin'!
2013,"I'm washin' windows, you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!"
2014,"Fine job, gentlemen."
2015,You may get out of this yet.
2016,I can't believe this is the same car.
2017,"Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet."
2018,Phase one is complete    clean the car    which moves us right along to phase two: clean you two.
2019,Strip.
2020,All the way?
2021,WOLF To your bare ass.
2022,"Quickly, gentlemen."
2023,We got about 15 minutes...
2024,before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.
2025,"Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit."
2026,Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
2027,You know what you two look like?
2028,VINCENT What?
2029,Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.
2030,Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.
2031,Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
2032,"Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for Otto the garbageman to pick up."
2033,You know what I'm sayin'?
2034,"Don't worry, we're taking it with us."
2035,"Jim, the soap."
2036,Vincent.
2037,"WOLF Okay, gentlemen."
2038,"You both been to county before, I'm sure. Here it comes."
2039,Goddamn!

2048,"Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!"
2049,"Uh, um    Towel."
2050,WOLF You're dry enough.
2051,Toss 'em their clothes.
2052,WOLF LAUGHING Perfect.
2053,Perfect. We couldn't have planned this better.
2054,"You guys look like    What do they look like, Jimmie?"
2055,Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
2056,"LAUGHING BOTH LAUGHING Hahaha. They're your clothes, motherfucker."
2057,"Come on, gentlemen."
2058,We're laughing our way right into prison.
2059,Don't make me beg.
2060,"Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight."
2061,We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
2062,Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
2063,"The place is North Hollywood, so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way."
2064,"Now, I'll drive the tainted car."
2065,"Jules, you ride with me."
2066,"Vincent, you follow in my Acura."
2067,"Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something."
2068,Right.
2069,What did I say?
2070,Don't do shit unless.
2071,Unless what?
2072,Unless you do it first.
2073,Spoken like a true prodigy.
2074,"How about you, Lash LaRue?"
2075,Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
2076,"Mr. Wolf, look, the gun went off."
2077,I don't know why.
2078,"I'm cool, I promise you."
2079,"Fair enough. Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up."
2080,"If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies."
2081,"METAL DOOR SLAMMING ENGINE IDLING Outta my way, Rex."
2082,We cool?
2083,Like it never happened.
2084,VINCENT All right.
2085,"Boys, this is Raquel."

2087,"Hi. So, what's with the outfits?"
2088,You guys going to a volleyball game or something?
2089,WOLF LAUGHS I'm takin' milady out to breakfast.

2094,It's    It's your future. I    I see a    a cab ride.
2095,"Move outta the sticks, fellas."
2096,"Say good night, Raquel."
2097,"Good night, Raquel."
2098,I'll see you guys around.
2099,"Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids."
2100,"Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work."
2101,"Yeah, really. And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf."
2102,Call me Winston.
2103,"You see that, young lady?"
2104,Respect.
2105,ALARM DEACTIVATES Respect for one's elders shows character.
2106,I have character.
2107,Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.
2108,CHUCKLES TIRES SCREECHING Wanna share a cab?
2109,I'd go for some breakfast.
2110,Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
2111,PHONE DIALING Cool.
2112,"I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something."
2113,"Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob."
2114,I know that now.
2115,But was he cool or what?
2116,Thank you.
2117,"Totally fuckin' cool, in control."
2118,Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
2119,CHUCKLES Want some bacon?
2120,"No, man, I don't eat pork."
2121,Are you Jewish?
2122,"I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all."
2123,Why not?
2124,Pigs are filthy animals.
2125,I don't eat filthy animals.
2126,"Yeah, but bacon tastes good."
2127,Pork chops taste good.
2128,"Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know..."
2129,'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.
2130,Pigs sleep and root in shit.
2131,That's a filthy animal.
2132,I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.
2133,How about a dog?
2134,Dog eats its own feces.
2135,I don't eat dog either.
2136,"Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?"
2137,"I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty."
2138,But a dog's got personality.
2139,Personality goes a long way.
2140,"Ah, so, by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal."
2141,Is that true?
2142,We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
2143,"I mean, he'd have to be that Arnold on Green Acres."
2144,"BOTH LAUGHING Oh, man, that's good."
2145,"That's good, man."
2146,You're startin' to lighten up.
2147,"You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit."
2148,"I just been sittin' here, thinkin'."
2149,About what?
2150,About the miracle we witnessed.
2151,Miracle you witnessed.
2152,I witnessed a freak occurrence.
2153,"What is a miracle, Vincent?"
2154,Act of God.
2155,And what's an act of God?
2156,"When, um, God makes the impossible possible."
2157,But this morning...
2158,I don't think qualifies.
2159,"Hey, Vincent."
2160,"Don't you see, that shit don't matter."
2161,You're judging this shit the wrong way.
2162,"I mean it could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys."
2163,You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
2164,"Now, whether or not what we experienced..."
2165,was an AccordingtoHoyle miracle is insignificant.
2166,"But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God."
2167,God got involved.
2168,But why?
2169,"Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why."
2170,But I can't go back to sleep.
2171,You're serious.
2172,You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
2173,For life?
2174,Yeah.
2175,Most definitely.
2176,Fuck.
2177,What you gonna do then?
2178,"Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating."
2179,First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.
2180,"Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the earth."
2181,"What you mean, ""Walk the earth""?"
2182,Like Caine in Kung Fu.
2183,"Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures."
2184,And how long do you intend to walk the earth?
2185,'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.
2186,And what if he don't do that?
2187,"If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever."
2188,So you decided to be a bum.
2189,"I'll just be Jules, Vincent."
2190,"No more, no less."
2191,"No, Jules, you decided to be a bum, just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away."
2192,"They got a name for that, Jules    It's called a bum."
2193,"And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man."
2194,You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
2195,"Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ."
2196,Gar  on! Coffee!
2197,"Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar."
2198,"But water into wine, I    All shapes and sizes, Vincent."
2199,"Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man."
2200,"If my answers frighten you, then you should cease asking scary questions."
2201,I'm gonna take a shit.
2202,Let me ask you something.
2203,"When did you make this decision, when you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?"
2204,"Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee, replayin' the incident in my head, when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity."
2205,Fuck.
2206,To be continued.

2230,"I think we got a hero here, honey bunny."
2231,"Well, just execute him!"

2273,Your boss makes you do his laundry?
2274,When he wants it clean.
2275,Sounds like a shit job.
2276,"Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing."
2277,Open it.
2278,'Fraid I can't do that.
2279,I didn't hear you.
2280,"Yes, you did."
2281,What's going on?
2282,Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
2283,Shoot him in the face!
2284,"I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me."

2327,"All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?"
2328,Don't you hurt him!
2329,Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
2330,We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.
2331,And what's Fonzie like?
2332,"Come on, Yolanda!"

2336,Cool.
2337,Correctamundo.
2338,And that's what we're gonna be.
2339,We're gonna be cool.
2340,"Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three."
2341,"And when I count three, I want you to let go of your gun, put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down."
2342,"And when you do it, you do it cool."
2343,You ready?
2344,"One, two, three."
2345,"PANTING Okay, now you let him go!"
2346,Yolanda!
2347,I thought you were gonna be cool.
2348,"Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous."
2349,"When I get nervous, I get scared."
2350,"When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot."
2351,"Just know, you hurt him, you die."
2352,"Well, that seems to be the situation."
2353,But I don't want that.
2354,And you don't want that.
2355,And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.
2356,So let's see what we can do.
2357,Now...
2358,here's the situation.
2359,"Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken, but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period, and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you."
2360,"But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me."
2361,"Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning..."
2362,to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
2363,Vincent!
2364,YELLS Be cool!
2365,"Yolanda, it's cool, baby."
2366,Get back!
2367,It's cool!
2368,We still just talkin'.
2369,Come on. Point the gun at me.
2370,Point the gun at me.
2371,YOLANDA WHIMPERING There you go.
2372,"Now, Vincent, you just hang back..."
2373,and don't do a goddamn thing.
2374,Tell her it's still cool.
2375,"It's still cool, honey bunny."
2376,"How we doin', baby?"
2377,I    I gotta go pee.
2378,I wanna go home.
2379,"Hang in there, baby."
2380,I'm proud of you.
2381,And Ringo's proud of you.
2382,It's almost over.
2383,Tell her you're proud of her.
2384,"I'm proud of you, honey bunny."
2385,I love you.
2386,"I love you too, honey bunny."
2387,"Now, I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet."
2388,Which one is it?
2389,"It's the one that says ""bad motherfucker."" That's it. That's my bad motherfucker."
2390,Open it up.
2391,Take out the money.
2392,JULES Count it.
2393,How much is there?
2394,"About 1,500 dollars."
2395,"Okay, put it in your pocket."
2396,It's yours.
2397,"Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh?"
2398,"Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle."
2399,"No, Yolanda! Yolanda!"
2400,"He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!"
2401,"Vince, shut the fuck up!"
2402,Shut up!
2403,"Come on, Yolanda."
2404,"Stay with me, baby."
2405,"Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent."
2406,I'm buyin' something for my money.
2407,"Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?"
2408,What?
2409,Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass.
2410,"You read the Bible, Ringo?"
2411,"Not regularly, no."
2412,"Well, there's this passage I got memorized."
2413,Ezekiel 25:17.
2414,"""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."
2415,"""by the inequities of the selfish..."
2416,"""and the tyranny of evil men."
2417,"""Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, ""shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, ""for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children."
2418,"""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."
2419,"""those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers."
2420,"""And you will know I am the Lord..."
2421,"when I lay my vengeance upon you."" I been sayin' that shit for years, and if you heard it, that meant your ass."
2422,I never gave much thought to what it meant.
2423,I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...
2424,before I popped a cap in his ass.
2425,But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.
2426,"See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means..."
2427,"you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man, and Mr. 9millimeter here, he's the shepherd..."
2428,protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness.
2429,Or it could mean...
2430,"you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd, and it's the world that's evil and selfish."
2431,"Yeah, I'd like that."
2432,But that shit ain't the truth.
2433,"The truth is, you're the weak..."
2434,and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
2435,"But I'm tryin', Ringo."
2436,I'm tryin' real hard...
2437,to be the shepherd.
2438,Go.
2439,I think we should be leaving now.
2440,"       ""SURF RIDER"" Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
