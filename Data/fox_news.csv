2,"Groping people in public wasn't already illegal? What's up with that, Deutschland?",0
3,"Merkel, possible the only person in charge who is worse than what we have. Obama is trying his hardest though to get to Merkel's level. ""A 21-year-old Iraqi man was convicted of sexual assault and given a one-year suspended sentence. A 26-year-old Algerian man was convicted of abetting a sexual assault and attempted assault, and given the same sentence."" Sounds exactly like how Obama is trying to let all of the black people in this country get away with everything.",2
4,"They know very well, no means NO They need to pass a law making it legal to castrate those animals.",2
5,look like merkel just want to get laid,2
6,""" but criticized two measures in the bill that could see people who aren't directly involved in the assault punished and foreigners deported for sexual harassment"" Sounds like some German Legislators have the same mental disease the Democrats and Republicans who opposed Kate's Law had. Deporting people who are not citizens for acting like savages - how cruel (sarcasm)",2

9,Probably a lot less. What's your point?,2
10,"In true liberal fashion, an ordinance that no means no, was passed. That will end all rapes by muslimes in Fatherland.",2
11,The Russians raped millions of German women and children at the end of WWII. Now the German people have to contend with this bunch of savages? How pathetic is it that a country has to cow-tow to a hoard of uncivilized migrants. Take your country back Germany.,2
12,"Great, now lets have a talk with Africa.",2
13,"Imagine that, Muslims are the problem...?",2
14,A one-year suspended sentence? Wow. That's really harsh.,0
15,Even though the woman was lying about the whole thing....LOL,0
16,You mean all 50?,0
17,"This will work great, just like the bracelets they handed out that said don't touch me. Liebrals will never learn. hahahahahahaha",2

26,"That's it pass more laws, you know cause paper and ink prevents crime.",0
27,"Ignorant troll. No one said the new law will prevent crime, just that it will make it easier to prosecute criminals --- which is a good thing.",0
28,no habla deutch.... No means white chicks want you more in Arabic mongrelland German politicians that approved of the refugee invaders are responsible for each and every crime committed by these mongrels German citizens should kick all politicians and refugee invaders OUT.,2

41,"Learn to read. Previous law required a victim to put up a physical struggle before the rapist could be prosecuted.. The new law only requires her to say ""no"".",0
42,So if they are alone who has to prove it was said?,0
43,Government is the impossibility of reason........... Platoon,0
44,The Germans invited this filth into their once-great nation by electing Merkel -- and handed law and order over to the EU bureaucrats in Brussels. Now they are too timid to take their country back.,2
45,"Until the whole world recognizes Islam for what it is, HATE SPEECH, this type of barbarism will only go on. The Muslims feel it is their right to obey only the laws that they agree with. Sexist attitudes against women are a core belief of Islam.",2
46,"If Islam was only hate speech, they wouldn't be a problem, just an annoyance. Unfortunately Islam preaches, teaches, demands, applauds and rewards violent behavior. That is much worse than speech.",2
47,If it's not written in Sharia law (and it's NOT) then they (Muslims) ultimately won't care.,2

59,You can expel the Muslims too. That's the problem. They don't care about your laws.,2
60,"Of course no means no. But not to a mooh-slum. Germany allowed these terrorist into their country, now live with it.",2
61,I get the impression that the German people really didn't have much of a say in it. Just another of example of Merkel/Obama progressivness.,0
62,"No say? They elected Merkel, in large numbers.",0
63,"No the people didn't the LOUSY LEADER DID, just like ODUMBO IS DOING HERE",0

68,"Yes there is, it's called capital punishment.",0
69,"The problem was never the law or lack of a law, it was the immigrants the politicians let into the country.",2
70,And its the reason-one of them anyway that some Muzlim countries do not even allow one of these scumbags into their country. NOT ONE They knew what would happen with these uncivilized animals and what they would do and they did exactly that to the women -young girls- and even have raped men. They should never be allowed out of their sand boxes.,2
71,"That just isn't going to work. How many different languages do German women need to learn to say ""no"" in? I'd assume Arabic would be a key one.",2
72,hot high speed lead is an international language,2
73,They should allow the German women weapons to protect themselves.,0
74,"Or......fathers, brothers, cousins of the women should protect them. How about that?",0
75,Sounds like Islam...a woman cannot leave her house unless accompanied by a male relative.,0
76,Then let them get raped. I don't really care. Go near one of the women in my family though. Different story.,2
77,"If in an Islamic country the raped woman is considered to have dishonored her family and subject to beatings by her family if not subjected to an ""honor killing"".",0
78,Add to that....if they do protect the women--there should be no prosecution for them for what they do to these scumbags.,0
79,This is a religion that condones the treating of women as chattel. You let them into your country. What did you expect??,2
80,"Saying ""no"" does not stop rapists. Keeping droves of men with ""raping"" mentality out of the country and arming people for self defense will help curb the rapes.",2
81,You can make all the laws you want. They won't control savages. You can dress an animal up like a man; it doesn't make it a man.,2

That is some aggressive sentencing there, I am absolutely certain that will deter such behavior from them in the future.",0

102,Another civilized country being destroyed by brown invaders.,2
103,Hundreds of women were raped and molested in the New Year's Eve travesty. And only ONE conviction so far? This only became a problem when Germany opened its borders to hordes of women-hating Muslims.,2
104,"And he was given a one year, suspended sentence. Hardly a deterrent.",0
105,Hard to punish a people that view women as their toys. Their religion allows this.,2

107,Agreed,2
108,"first immigrate them, then seduce them and then get them into acts where they dont want to hear NO. And then get them to jail if they are not submissive.",2
109,"nice, but it doesn't help these women who were physically assaulted.",0
110,The great German nation brought this on itself. And its citizens pay the price for letting barbarians in unchecked.,2
111,Why do they keep Merkel in office. The woman is a disaster for Germany. She knows nothing and does everything to hurt her country,0
112,She sounds like Hillary.,0
113,And Oblama,0
114,but barry loves her...,0
115,"Let me wrap my mind around this. A woman was raped by two men and a video shows her saying no and now she's on trial?? Yeah, we need European style justice here in America. And let me venture a guess. The opposition to the change that will allow deportation of these savages is the liberal wing of the equivalent to our own Democratic Party.",2
116,"In this case, the liberal wing you're referring to is in Brussels.",0
117,And people wonder why England voted FOR Brexit?,0
118,hasent no been on the books forever,0
119,But it has never been defined. /sarc,0
120,"depends on what the meaning of ""is"" - 'is"".",0

122,"Now we have reverse discrimination, BIG TIME because of this PERCEIVED PROBLEM that our DEAR LEADER intended to remedy by EXECUTIVE FIAT Just another reason why there should not be a federal department of education that doles out OUR OWN TAX MONEY and makes the states JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO GET IT Don't you think ENOUGH IS ENOUGH",0
123,"Transgender people have existed since the beginning of time. Some have just always kept the fact that they felt they were the wrong gender a secret and suffered in silence. Others actually lived as the other gender often after moving to a new location. Obviously they used the bathroom of the gender they were living as and no one knew, because unlike Christian Conservatives they didn't go into bathrooms or dressing areas flailing their gen italia around. But now that it's 2016, all of a sudden it's a problem. Why? Politics. And the awareness that these people exist.",0
124,but CHRISTIANS are the only reason why you care about gays or tgs you want them in all of our churches . of have us pay a huge fine right? that is your equal rights,0
125,Think for yourself for once.,0
126,I always do there is no bigger lie than equal rights for all,0
127,You're becoming far too repetitive.,0
128,you never do that Sharon?,0
129,"Honestly, who is Sharon? I don't get the joke.",0
130,so far thats you,0
131,You think my name is Sharon? OK?,0
132,glad you told us your name,0
133,"Seeing as that's not my name, nor did I ever say it was, I still have no idea what you're trying to say.",0
134,you just now said it was,0
135,"Well no, I didn't. So again, what in the world are you saying?",0
136,its nice to know your real name. its a pretty female name,0
137,"Ah, okay. You wish I was a woman. That's cr⁠e⁠epy, Wayne. Keep your fan⁠tas⁠ies to yourself.",0
138,so you admit being a woman?,2

140,"I came back to my post and saw ""16 replies"" and actually thought ""Wow, maybe my post generated some interesting conversation."" Then I clicked on it. OMG. Sharon was probably his third wife...and second daughter.",0
141,"Nah, he didn't come up with that one himself either. did and he's been parroting it. Like I said, he's not capable of an original thought.",0
142,"He's not capable of any thought, period",0
143,none that is a vote for Hilary,0
144,Republicans en masse are getting ready to turn their back on Trump the way they did on Bob Dole in '96 when it was clear he couldn't win against Bill Clinton.,0
145,no the opposite your polls poll mostly Democrats who can't stand Hilary who matters because of that cigar,0
146,The polls are accurate Wayne. Pollsters compete with each other for contracts and as a result focus on accuracy. They have no problem predicting elections within the margin of error. A couple like Fox and Rasmussen have a Republican house effect of around 3 points. A couple like PPP have a Dem house effect of around 3. The polls say Trump isn't doing very well. Worse than they said McCain and Romney were doing at this same time. EVEN Fox's polls.,0
147,why does that Neke Silver say that Trump will win by 57 percent?? they can easily find Democrats in Manhattans. but they don't like Hilary at all not many do,0
148,"If Trump ever endorses violence against liberals, I will comply with his wishes, gladly.",2

151,you do since I thought you did not like HRC that is a lie obviously,0
152,Hopefully the authorities come for you before election day.,0
153,The latest projections are the Orange Clown loses in a landslide.,0
154,Here's hoping he brings as many Republicans down with him as possible.,0
155,nope the Dems will dump Hilary like they dumped Carter in 80,0
156,Source?,0
157,They dumped Carter because he couldn't resolve the hostage crisis and inflation was out of control...after he was in office four years. Now why are they going to dump Hillary?,0
158,His overlords haven't told him that one yet.,0
159,"See what I mean? No answer, just repetition of the original statement.",0
160,nope a VOTE for hilary is what your only answer would be,0
161,"No, any answer to the question would be a fine answer.",0
162,nope because the Dems rejected Carter and will do the same to Hilary. they want no more four years of Monica Lewinski,2
163,Monica Lewinski lol.,2
164,why not? she is why Hilary matters,0
165,Liberals can't distinguish men from women. Nor do they want to.,2
166,Cons can't distinguish morality from the rantings of a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe.,2
167,and liberals use that same book and blast Christians day and night falsely,0
168,Freedomscout thinks the public schools are like Pink Floyd's The Wall.,0
169,I wish he'd publish his book already and stop spamming here.,0
170,and the left wants homeschooling banned.,0
171,Not me.,0
172,He's just spouting off the nonsense he hears on TV. He's not capable of critical thought.,0
173,"Or it was conservative talk radio. A caller into Han nity says it and Han nity says ""Oh you're right. You're right."" And then they run around to friends and family wringing their hands as the repeat it as fact.",0
174,"Given small handful of names that appear in Wayne's tweets, it's definitely FOX.",0
175,I know SB (sharon) does,0
176,I would like to see the quote.,0
177,Don't hold your breath.,0
178,just replied to me below. Read it if you dare. It's so sad.,0
179,I don't bother reading his posts. Everything coming from a creationist is nonsense.,2
180,I wonder which of your favorite talking heads just said that on TV.,0
181,"I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?",0
182,"The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that ""transgenderism"" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that ""transgenderism"" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding ""transgenderism"" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.",2
183,"Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a ""real thing"" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.",0
184,"Transgenderism is just that, an ""ism"", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say ""real thing"" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.",2
185,"""Trangenderism"" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong.",0
186,"To call some confusion of mind ""real"" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to ""evil"" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?",2
187,"Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?",0
188,"The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.",0
189,"How will you go about ""curing"" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be ""normal"" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide.",0
190,"Also they are not ""confused"" as they are well aware of their own bodies.",0
191,"There is a common misconception that one can somehow ""force"" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes ""mental"" as physical, of the brain, instead of the ""mind"". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.",2
192,"Again you have not given any viable solution. The ""spiritual counseling"" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.",0
193,"The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as ""spiritual counselling"" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.",2
194,Seems like general statements again. What is so obviously wrong or evil about it. What actual harm is being caused by their choices?,0
195,"""Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."" - Luke 13",0
196,No one?,0
197,No one as in nobody is answering or no one as in nobody is going to be last in heaven despite what Jesus said?,0
198,"No one, as in my guess is no one.",0
199,I will be last if you just need someone to close up shop. Does room service exist in Heavan? I hope it is a fun place and not just a bunch of religious nuts praying and such.,0
200,"Oh it's going to be a fun place all right. So, as Jesus said earlier in this chapter, "" “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.""",0
201,"So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?",0
202,"Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, ""science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate"". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to ""put the monkey"" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God.",2
203,"How will it harm our ""civil society""? Be specific, now.",0
204,Did you not understand the question?,0
206,I think he's stumped on that one.,0
207,Seems so.,0
208,"First, the terms ""discriminate"" and ""discrimination"" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony – Freedomscout ""Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."" - Luke 13",0
209,"I try to live by that ""Do unto others"" bit.",0
210,"which ""other people?"" that has a hidden meaning and means HOMOSEXUALS. we see that the left faith ISLAM never had to be kind to ""others"" in Orlando did they? it depends a LOT on the religion. we watched while 102 ""others"" got shot in a bar yet we get sued over a cake that VERY selective morality would make Jesus angry.",2
211,"Of all the sick moves Obama has made, this has to be the top He seems to think that as president, the people MUST sereve HIM, not that he should be serving the PEOPLE. The only people he seems to feel obligated to serve are those without morals, which he apparently feels he is part of Even though he only has a few months left in his term, the house and senate should be calling themselves back into session and impeaching him Under Obama and Clinton this country has become an immoral, dirtier than dirt nation I suggest he send his children to a public school affected by this despotic rule Just to show us how much he believes it",2
213,So you think it is fine to protect the rights of immoral people while taking the rights from innocent women to have their privacy?,2
214,people? Who?,0
215,that is who.,2
216,"If you don't understand what transgender is, go talk to your family doctor. They cover it in medical school.",0
217,I understand completely who they are. You are the one that has bought into the lie that they were born with some genetic defect. Transgender is a sick perversion.,2
218,Transgenders are immoral? That's news to me. I personally know two and they're not immoral.,0
219,Like your morals don't fall into question by supporting this.,0
220,Why should they?,0
221,Simply because people like you are out to change what is considered moral into something that isn't.,2

224,No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before. So I guess you think we should still have sla very? I'm not surprised. It's biblical too.,0
225,Nice tactic to switch the conversation.,0
226,I'm just identifying exactly where your so called morals are coming from.,0
227,Not hardly.,0
228,Oh really? Then where?,0
229,Your interpretation of the Bible is flawed so making you understand anything from it will never happen until you recognize your need for a savior.,0
230,So you admit it. Your morality is coming from the bible and not science or medicine. Thank you for making my point.,0
231,"So his morality is based on what was prevalent in the Middle East about 2000 years ago. Nothing like keeping up to date, eh?",0
232,Notice how she took off when it came down to actually having to defend God's Word.,0
233,Yep,0
234,its where YOURS comes from too the Bible is why you push TG and gays its a lot more than a book,2
235,Deuteronomy 22,0
236,Leviticus 25,0
237,JEWISH LAWS they don't do that. but you care about the return of slavery via gay marriage,2
238,Exodus 21,0
239,your faith ISLAM is far worse toward slaves than we are,2
240,"Where do they come from, then?",0
241,Like your morals don't fall into question by getting your info about human se xuality and gender identity from a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe that had no problem with adults marrying children and thought the appropriate way to deal with ra pe was to make the ra pist marry the victim.,0
242,Or stone the victim.,0
243,like Muslims do already,2
244,Discriminate against them in what way?,0
245,By telling them they can't use the bathroom or facilities of the gender that they're living as and under medical and mental health guidance to live as...as they have been for decades.,0
246,someone use the bathroom of their actual gender is not discrimination. A man who identifies as a woman (or vice versa) does not mean he is a woman.,2
247,Except that that's not their actual gender. They're the gender they're living as.,0
248,is not a choice. You're born male or female. It doesn't change because you think your the opposite.,2

252,"That doesn't make sense. If I know the difference between the two words, but used the wrong one, that is a typo. This isn't a college paper, I'm not proofreading or checking for auto correct issues. Again, I notice no counter argument from you on the actual post though.",0

254,"And you can't understand a typo. Or just hide behind that claim since you can't argue the point, which is more likely in this case.",0

256,Ask your family doctor about it. They'll explain it to you.,0
257,"It's pretty simple. A woman does not change into a man by thinking it. She is still a woman. No issue with her thinking/acting like a man, but that isn't what she is, physically.",2

259,?,0
260,No answer huh? there is no way you are for equal rights,0
261,no answer? You didn't ask a question.,0
262,I did make a statement. I admit that,0

264,"While I empathize with the sentiment and agree that Obama's motives are evil, the long standing evil of murderous abortion has been a terrible part of the moral decadence in America for 43 years now.

265,"The added confusion this is all bringing to children, youth, adolescents and young adults is tragic and so unnecessary. Parents are having a very difficult time shielding their children from the foolish influences of our culture that is creating so much uncertainty and relativism in the minds of youth...largely through social media and sadly through government schooling.",0
266,"- The confusion is added by people following an ancient mythology that have no respect for science, medicine and psychology.",0
267,How does that have anything to do with it?,0

269,"Many religions are poisonous to logic and truth, that much is true...and human beings still remain fallen human beings even they are Redeemed by the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. So there's that. But the fallacies of thinking cannot be limited or attributed to religion but to error inherent in human motivation, the motivation to utter self-centeredness as fallen sinful human beings. Nearly all of the world's many religions are expressions of that utter sinful nature...Christianity and Judaism being the sole exceptions.",2

370,"Vaughan cited the case of Sarah Root, who was killed in a car crash in Omaha, Neb., in January after Eswin Mejia slammed his car into hers while he was intoxicated and drag racing. Mejia is an illegal immigrant who arrived into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, and who had several previous brushes with the law, said Vaughan. “The local detectives asked ICE five times for a detainer on Eswin Mejia, but ICE said that he was not a priority for enforcement because he had not been convicted of a serious crime,” Vaughan said. “He was released on bail and disappeared, and is now on ICE’s most wanted list. It was a major scandal for ICE.” In another instance, Johnny Josue Sanchez, 21, a Honduran national in the country illegally who had been arrested three times, allegedly killed five homeless people when he set fire to a vacant building in Los Angeles. In this case, Vaughan said the combination of ICE’s and Los Angeles’s disinterest in removing Sanchez after so-called previous “minor” offenses resulted in tragedy. In yet another case, Marilyn Pharis, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer on July 24, 2015, in her own home. Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez, 29, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was arrested six times in the previous 15 months, was one of two men charged in the case.

Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as",0

847,I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane. This country would rather name a ship after a gay right activist then a person of the military maybe a person who died defended America. I am sorry but this is just wrong. It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.,2
848,How does naming a ship after him give gays more clout as you say? The navy decided to name this class of ship after people making significant contributions to civil and human rights. Milk did that for the gay community. There are many other classes of ships named after military personnel.,0

Your point that South Carolina should remove the Confederate Flag from the State House is wrong, and it surprises me that you failed to do the proper research. The state legislature removed the Confederate Flag from the State House on 1 July 2000.

But don't understand how 13% of the population can tell the rest of us that we have to believe what they believe, and we cannot honor our ancestors who fought the North in the civil war by flying a flag on our private residence if we choose to. Two weeks ago I started flying both the American flag as well as the confederate battle flag daily. Don't like it, make your opinions known from the street, touch my flag and I'll defend my possessions as its attached to my house. Since I started flying it, 5 other neighbors have started flying theirs as well. All of which used to fly the American flag on flag day, holidays, and anytime it felt right to do so, now they all fly the Rebel flag(battle flag) as we feel we are under attack, not from minorities who live in the south, but once again from activists from the North, forcing their opinions and rules and regulations on us where they have no right to do so. I am rebelling against that in the easiest way I can, by flying a flag that I have displayed on my first car for 40 years, and flying the flag of my College, and the confederacy...regardless if it lost a war or not.

906,The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.,0
907,"The Federal Government violates the constitution left and right. Read the Judge's piece, ""Imagine America without the Constitution"" to see just a few clear examples. Our nation was intended to be one of numerous separate sovereign States, yielded limited authority to a central government for the purpose of patrolling the coasts for piracy, minting currency, and other things that a Federal government would be able to do more efficiently than all the States separately. Lincoln would undoubtedly role over in his grave if he would have seen how the Federal Government would have used the Civil War to strip states of their rights and powers… The Federal government just votes itself more power year after year.",0

Maybe we should be more concerned with the atrocities done to the natives of America. Maybe they should be slightly more offended by the flag flying over the White House. Many people who love the constitution would prefer the Gadsen Flag (Don't Tread on Me) replace the old, clearly offensive, stars and bars design anyway. Hug an ancestor of a slave.

Deliberate bombing of civilian centers in Germany and Japan instead of only industrial targets. Thousands wiped out in a fiery holocaust in just 2 days in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using atomic weapons.

New York was the first to test this during the first ""civil war"" of 1812, when NY's legislature drafted articles of succession. Had the Brits decided to back off after burning D.C., NY and other Eastern States may have tried to leave the Union. The Southern States might have said ""good riddance"".

I have been working since 1965. I used food stamps once for 3 months to feed my child while I looked for a new job in 1971. But it had limits & you could not buy frivolous junk food.

I was very appreciate of having the help available until I could get back on my feet but a 'welfare life' deforms your spirit, if its not already deformed enough to find that life acceptable. The essentials of power, transport, etc are so expensive, and the knockbacks so demoralising and the eventual inertia so debilitating, that sometimes you sink into despondency. If eligable welfare recipients were matched up with something they could align to personally ( I worked at a farm and an emergency relief food outlet , both which I liked), i could see it working for all concerned. Unfortunately, I could see this becoming an almost work-for - the-state situation and taken to its end-point, that gives me the heebie jeebies.",0

Sometimes it's as simple as tree stumps being removed to make, as in this case, a man made lake. The owners don't want people hurt on the remaining stumps until they have rotted away. They walked together on a beach and the little boy was in less than 12"" of water. Now if the signs that were posted would have said ""DANGER ALLIGATORS IN WATER"" I could see how you might have a point. However, you do not.",0

1466,"FL protects alligators too much, alligators are serial killers, they eat anything anyone any pet, they can. Sad the media has convinced the public that these killers should be ""protected by law""? Hope they learn why some creatures are not desirable neighbors? They should all be re-located to the Everglades (the gators and the media, lol), that would help their tourism and make the rest of FL safer. Same for the Bear issues, Over Development destroys the Bears natural habitat so they have to search for food more and farther, so its mans doing; just Re-Locate them to the Rockies perhaps, that would not require the Bears killed,who are only looking for food most all the times. Too, Disney should have 2 barriers between any dangerous animal or creature and the public. Even a good parent can be caught unawares. Its just human nature to not always be 100% on guard.",0
