1,2,"00:00:32,584","00:00:35,044",You always say that. The same thing every time.
2,3_4,"00:00:35,128","00:00:40,591","""I'm through, never again, too dangerous."" I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too."
3,5,"00:00:40,717","00:00:44,095",-You forget about it in a day or two. -The days of me forgetting are over.
4,6,"00:00:44,179","00:00:46,264",The days of me remembering have just begun.
5,7,"00:00:46,348","00:00:48,432","You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like?"
6,8,"00:00:48,559","00:00:51,561",-I sound like a sensible fuckin' man. -You sound like a duck.
7,9,"00:00:51,687","00:00:55,147","-Quack, quack, quack. -Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again."
8,10,"00:00:55,232","00:00:58,651","Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack."
9,11,"00:00:58,777","00:01:03,447",-After tonight? -Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
10,12,"00:01:03,574","00:01:06,409","-Can I get anyone more coffee? -Oh, yes!"
11,13,"00:01:08,245","00:01:10,788",-Thank you. -You're welcome.
12,14_15,"00:01:10,873","00:01:16,836","I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank."
13,16,"00:01:16,920","00:01:18,963",Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.
14,17,"00:01:19,047","00:01:22,049",Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.
15,18,"00:01:22,134","00:01:26,345",They're insured. Why should they give a fuck? I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
16,19,"00:01:26,430","00:01:29,891","Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone."
17,20_21_22,"00:01:29,975","00:01:39,442","He gives the phone to a teller. The bloke on the other end says, ""We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."" -Did it work? -Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about."
18,23,"00:01:39,526","00:01:45,323","Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone."
19,24,"00:01:45,449","00:01:50,036",-Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger. -Did they hurt the little girl?
20,25,"00:01:50,120","00:01:53,831",There probably never was a little girl. The point of the story isn't a little girl.
21,26,"00:01:53,916","00:01:56,876",The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.
22,27,"00:01:56,960","00:01:59,921",-You want to rob banks? -I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
23,28,"00:02:00,005","00:02:02,423","I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing."
24,29,"00:02:02,507","00:02:06,636","-No more liquor stores? -What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores."
25,30,"00:02:06,762","00:02:09,722","Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be. There's too many foreigners own liquor stores."
26,31,"00:02:09,806","00:02:11,724","Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English."
27,32,"00:02:11,808","00:02:14,143","You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about."
28,33,"00:02:14,227","00:02:16,103",They make it too personal.
29,34,"00:02:16,229","00:02:20,441","-We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him. -I'm not gonna kill anybody."
30,35,"00:02:20,525","00:02:24,820",I don't want to either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.
31,36_37,"00:02:24,905","00:02:29,533","And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations."
32,38,"00:02:29,618","00:02:34,038",You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
33,39,"00:02:34,122","00:02:36,040",Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.
34,40,"00:02:36,124","00:02:38,000",See how far that gets you. Forget it.
35,41,"00:02:38,126","00:02:41,003","-We're out of it. -Well, what then, day jobs?"
36,42,"00:02:41,129","00:02:43,172",-Not in this life. -What then?
37,43,"00:02:45,342","00:02:47,510","Gar  on, coffee!"
38,44,"00:02:47,594","00:02:49,887",This place.
39,45,"00:02:51,348","00:02:54,475","""Gar  on"" means boy."
40,46,"00:02:57,688","00:03:00,356",This place? A coffee shop?
41,47,"00:03:00,440","00:03:03,401",What's wrong with that?
42,48,"00:03:03,485","00:03:07,154",Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?
43,49_50,"00:03:08,115","00:03:14,328","Bars, liquor stores, gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them."
44,51,"00:03:14,413","00:03:18,082","Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down."
45,52,"00:03:18,166","00:03:21,794",They're not expectin' to get robbed. Not as expectin' anyway.
46,53,"00:03:21,920","00:03:26,424",-I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this. -Correct.
47,54,"00:03:26,508","00:03:29,760","Same as banks, these places are insured."
48,55,"00:03:29,845","00:03:32,179",Manager. He don't give a fuck.
49,56,"00:03:32,264","00:03:35,099",They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.
50,57,"00:03:35,183","00:03:39,145",Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.
51,58,"00:03:39,229","00:03:42,148",Busboys. Some wetback gettin' paid $1.50 an hour...
52,59,"00:03:42,232","00:03:44,734",really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner?
53,60,"00:03:44,818","00:03:47,862","Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on."
54,61,"00:03:47,988","00:03:52,658","One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face."
55,62,"00:03:52,743","00:03:57,788","See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember?"
56,63,"00:03:57,873","00:04:00,541",-All the customers kept comin' in. -Yeah.
57,64,"00:04:00,625","00:04:04,462","You got the idea of takin' their wallets. Now, that was a good idea."
58,65,"00:04:04,546","00:04:07,882",-Thank you. -Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.
59,66,"00:04:08,008","00:04:10,301","-Yes, we did. -A lot of people come to restaurants."
60,67,"00:04:10,385","00:04:14,013","-A lot of wallets. -Pretty smart, huh?"
61,68,"00:04:14,097","00:04:16,140",Pretty smart.
62,69,"00:04:17,684","00:04:20,644","I'm ready. Let's do it. Right now, right here."
63,70,"00:04:20,771","00:04:25,274","-Come on. -All right. Same as last time, remember?"
64,71,"00:04:25,358","00:04:28,110",You're crowd control. I'll handle the employees.
65,72,"00:04:33,784","00:04:36,535","-I love you, pumpkin. -I love you, honey bunny."
66,73,"00:04:37,746","00:04:40,206",Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

71,90,"00:07:16,321","00:07:19,615","I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places."

73,92,"00:07:22,452","00:07:24,787",It's legal to buy it. It's legal to own it.
74,93,"00:07:24,871","00:07:28,040","And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it."
75,94,"00:07:28,124","00:07:32,544","It's illegal to carry it, but-but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this."

85,105,"00:08:07,998","00:08:11,500",a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
86,106,"00:08:11,584","00:08:13,752",They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
87,107,"00:08:13,837","00:08:16,630",They got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.
88,108,"00:08:16,715","00:08:20,551",-What do they call it? -They call it a Royale with Cheese.
89,109,"00:08:20,677","00:08:22,136",-Royale with Cheese. -That's right.
90,110,"00:08:22,220","00:08:24,138",What do they call a Big Mac?

96,117,"00:08:48,580","00:08:51,874",We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
97,118,"00:08:54,878","00:08:57,588",-How many up there? -Three or four.
98,119,"00:08:57,714","00:09:01,258",-That's countin' our guy? -Not sure.
99,120,"00:09:01,384","00:09:04,762",-So that means that it could be up to five guys up there? -It's possible.
100,121,"00:09:04,846","00:09:07,181",We should have fuckin' shotguns.
101,122,"00:09:07,307","00:09:09,892",-: What's her name? - Mia.
102,123,"00:09:10,018","00:09:14,188",-Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet? -I don't know.
103,124,"00:09:14,272","00:09:17,858",However people meet people. She used to be a actress.
104,125,"00:09:17,942","00:09:20,402","Oh, really? She do anything I'd have seen?"
105,126,"00:09:20,528","00:09:24,907",-I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot. -Pilot? What's a pilot?
106,127,"00:09:25,033","00:09:28,535","-Well, you know the shows on TV? -I don't watch TV."
107,128_129,"00:09:28,650","00:09:35,417","Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television, -and on this invention they show shows, right? -Yeah."
108,130,"00:09:35,502","00:09:39,880",The way they pick TV shows is they make one show. That show's called a pilot.
109,131,"00:09:39,964","00:09:42,883",Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...
110,132,"00:09:42,900","00:09:45,886","and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows."
111,133,"00:09:45,970","00:09:50,516","Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothin'."
112,134,"00:09:50,650","00:09:53,769",She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
113,135,"00:09:53,853","00:09:56,605",You remember Antwan Rockamora?
114,136_137,"00:09:56,689","00:10:03,987","Half-black, half-Samoan. Used to call him ""Tony Rocky Horror."" -Yeah, maybe. Fat, right? -I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat."
115,138,"00:10:04,072","00:10:06,824","He got a weight problem. I mean, what's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan."
116,139,"00:10:06,950","00:10:11,370",-I think I know who you mean. What about him? -Marsellus fucked him up good.
117,140,"00:10:11,454","00:10:15,707",Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
118,142,"00:10:23,842","00:10:27,845","-So what he'd do? Fuck her? -No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad."
119,143,"00:10:27,971","00:10:31,640","-Well, then what then? -He gave her a foot massage."
120,144,"00:10:33,893","00:10:36,103",A foot massage?
121,145,"00:10:36,229","00:10:38,272",-That's it? -Mm-hmm.
122,146,"00:10:38,356","00:10:40,274",Then what'd Marsellus do?
123,147,"00:10:40,358","00:10:43,527",Sent a couple cats over to his place. They took him out on his patio.
124,148,"00:10:43,611","00:10:47,531",Threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.
125,149,"00:10:47,615","00:10:51,660","He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse."
126,150,"00:10:51,744","00:10:53,996",Nigger fell through that.
127,151,"00:10:54,080","00:10:56,999","Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment."
128,152,"00:10:58,501","00:11:01,211",-That's a damn shame. -Hmm.
129,153,"00:11:05,925","00:11:09,720","-But still, you play with matches, you get burned. -What do you mean?"
130,154,"00:11:09,804","00:11:13,932",You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
131,155,"00:11:14,017","00:11:16,477",You don't think he overreacted?
132,156,"00:11:16,561","00:11:21,440","Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction."
133,157,"00:11:21,524","00:11:25,652",It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
134,158,"00:11:25,737","00:11:29,281",It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.
135,159,"00:11:29,365","00:11:34,244","I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark."
136,160,"00:11:34,329","00:11:36,413","Whoa whoa whoa whoa, stop right there. Eatin' the bitch out..."
137,161,"00:11:36,498","00:11:39,041",and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.
138,162,"00:11:39,167","00:11:43,086",-It's not. It's the same ballpark. -Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
139,163,"00:11:43,171","00:11:46,089","Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine."
140,164,"00:11:46,174","00:11:49,927",But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...
141,165,"00:11:50,011","00:11:54,223",ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
142,166,"00:11:54,349","00:11:58,185",-Foot massages don't mean shit! -Have you ever given a foot massage?
143,167,"00:11:58,269","00:12:01,313", Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
144,168,"00:12:01,439","00:12:04,107",-I'm the foot fuckin' master. -You given a lot of them?
145,169,"00:12:04,192","00:12:08,403","Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'."

438,575,"00:39:49,272","00:39:52,983","Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show."
439,576,"00:39:53,067","00:39:55,611",-Tell me. -It's corny.
440,577,"00:39:56,529","00:39:58,572",Don't be that way. Tell me.
441,578_579,"00:39:58,698","00:40:06,330","-No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed. -You'd be embarr    You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me?"
442,580,"00:40:06,456","00:40:10,334","-I promise I won't laugh. -That's what I'm afraid of, Vince."
443,581,"00:40:10,418","00:40:12,711",That's not what I meant. You know it.
444,582,"00:40:12,795","00:40:16,215",Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.
445,583_584,"00:40:16,299","00:40:22,429",What a gyp.  Martin and Lewis.
446,585,"00:40:25,516","00:40:27,935",Vanilla Coke.
447,586,"00:40:32,273","00:40:35,567",Mmm. Yummy.
448,587,"00:40:35,652","00:40:38,612",You think I could have a sip of that?
449,588,"00:40:40,156","00:40:42,324",Be my guest.
450,589,"00:40:42,408","00:40:46,411",I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
451,590,"00:40:46,496","00:40:49,957","-You can use my straw. I don't have cooties. -Yeah, but maybe I do."
452,591,"00:40:50,041","00:40:52,876",Cooties I can handle.
453,592_593,"00:40:52,961","00:41:04,763","All right.        [""RUMBLE"" BEGINS] Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake!"
454,594,"00:41:04,889","00:41:08,976","-Told ya. -I don't know if it was worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good."
455,596,"00:41:43,886","00:41:47,431",-Don't you hate that? -Hate what?
456,597,"00:41:47,515","00:41:49,850",Uncomfortable silences.
457,598,"00:41:51,853","00:41:56,356",Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
458,599,"00:41:56,441","00:42:00,360",I don't know. That's a good question.
459,600,"00:42:00,445","00:42:05,157",That's when you know you found somebody really special.
460,601,"00:42:05,241","00:42:09,953",When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.
461,602,"00:42:10,038","00:42:14,166","Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad. We just met each other."
462,603,"00:42:15,626","00:42:18,754",I'll tell you what.
463,604,"00:42:18,838","00:42:22,090",I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.
464,605,"00:42:22,175","00:42:25,385",You sit here... and think of something to say.
465,606,"00:42:26,596","00:42:28,555",I'll do that.
466,607_611,"00:42:30,892","00:43:00,253",Okay. I said goddamn!
467,612,"00:43:00,338","00:43:03,507",Goddamn! Goddamn.
468,613,"00:43:06,094","00:43:08,720", I need some hair spray.
469,614_615,"00:43:10,765","00:43:16,520","       [""SINCE I FIRST MET YOU""] Mmmm."
470,616,"00:43:16,604","00:43:20,941",Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?
471,617,"00:43:21,025","00:43:23,402",We're lucky we got anything at all.
472,618,"00:43:23,486","00:43:26,613",I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.
473,619,"00:43:26,697","00:43:29,783",Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
474,620,"00:43:29,909","00:43:32,953","-Which one? There's two Monroes. -No, there's not."
475,621,"00:43:33,037","00:43:35,372",That is Marilyn Monroe.
476,622,"00:43:35,456","00:43:38,166",That is Mamie Van Doren.
477,623,"00:43:38,251","00:43:43,171","I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off."
478,624,"00:43:43,256","00:43:46,675",-Pretty smart. -Yeah. I got my moments.
479,625,"00:43:46,759","00:43:51,138","-So did you think of somethin' to say? -Actually, I did."
480,626_627_628,"00:43:52,765","00:44:02,357","However... you seem like a really nice person, and I    -I don't want to offend you. -Oooh."
481,629,"00:44:02,442","00:44:07,612","This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat."
482,630,"00:44:07,697","00:44:10,699",This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.
483,631,"00:44:10,783","00:44:13,535","Well, well, I do. I do."
484,632,"00:44:13,661","00:44:17,706","- But you have to promise not to be offended. -No, no no no."
485,633,"00:44:17,832","00:44:22,043",You can't promise somethin' like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
486,634,"00:44:22,128","00:44:26,965","You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended."
487,635,"00:44:27,049","00:44:29,384","Then through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise."
488,636,"00:44:29,510","00:44:32,179",-Let's just forget it. -That's an impossibility.
489,637,"00:44:32,263","00:44:36,308",Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
490,638_639,"00:44:36,392","00:44:43,690","-Is that a fact? -And besides, -isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission? -All right, all right."
491,640,"00:44:43,774","00:44:46,568","Well, here goes."
492,641,"00:44:46,652","00:44:49,654",What did you think about what happened to Antwan?
493,642,"00:44:49,739","00:44:53,158",-Who's Antwan? -Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
494,643,"00:44:53,242","00:44:56,453",-He fell out of a window. -Hmm. Hmm.
495,644,"00:44:56,537","00:45:01,249","Well, that is one way to say it. Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out."
496,645,"00:45:01,334","00:45:04,461",Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.
497,646,"00:45:04,545","00:45:09,674","Yet, even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you."
498,647,"00:45:09,759","00:45:12,177",-Is that a fact? -No.
499,648,"00:45:12,261","00:45:15,347","No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard. That's just what I heard."
500,649,"00:45:15,473","00:45:18,350",-Who told you? -They.
501,650,"00:45:18,434","00:45:20,894","""They"" talk a lot, don't they?"
502,652,"00:45:23,064","00:45:25,732",They certainly do. They certainly do.
503,653,"00:45:25,816","00:45:30,195","-Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did ""they"" say? -Well I'm    I'm not shy."
504,654,"00:45:30,279","00:45:32,822","-Um    -Did it involve the ""F"" word?"
505,655,"00:45:32,907","00:45:36,910","No--no, no, no, no, no. They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage."
506,656,"00:45:38,412","00:45:41,039",-And? -And    And nothin'.
507,657,"00:45:41,123","00:45:44,000",That's it.
508,658,"00:45:44,085","00:45:46,127",You heard Marsellus...
509,659,"00:45:46,212","00:45:50,507",threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage?
510,660,"00:45:50,633","00:45:52,551",-Mm-hmm. -And you believe that?
511,661,"00:45:52,635","00:45:57,180"," Well, I mean, the time I was told it sounded reasonable."
512,662,"00:45:57,265","00:46:00,350",Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window...
513,663,"00:46:00,434","00:46:03,478",for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
514,664,"00:46:03,563","00:46:07,023","No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen."
515,665,"00:46:07,108","00:46:09,734",I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.
516,666,"00:46:09,819","00:46:14,447",A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.
517,667,"00:46:14,532","00:46:18,243",A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
518,668,"00:46:18,527","00:46:20,870",But did it happen?
519,669,"00:46:21,050","00:46:26,835",Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
520,670_671,"00:46:26,919","00:46:32,716","Really? Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window..."
521,672,"00:46:32,700","00:46:34,718",except Marsellus and Tony.
522,673,"00:46:34,802","00:46:38,763","When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle."
523,674,"00:46:38,848","00:46:42,767",Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment you've all been waiting for.

528,680,"00:47:02,872","00:47:05,165",-Right here! - All right!
529,681,"00:47:05,249","00:47:08,251","-I wanna dance. -No, no, no, no, no, no."
530,682_683,"00:47:08,336","00:47:16,551","No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted."
531,684,"00:47:16,636","00:47:20,305",Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.
532,685,"00:47:20,389","00:47:22,974",-So dance good. -All right. You asked for it.
533,686,"00:47:23,059","00:47:26,019",Let's hear it for our first contestants.
534,687,"00:47:30,650","00:47:35,904","Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name?"
535,688,"00:47:35,988","00:47:37,947",Mrs. Mia Wallace.
536,689,"00:47:38,032","00:47:40,659",And how 'bout your fella here?

538,691,"00:47:42,662","00:47:46,039","All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away!"
539,692,"00:47:46,165","00:47:49,084",- Go for it. - Come on!

724,1003,"01:08:58,686","01:09:02,314",Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.
725,1004,"01:09:02,398","01:09:05,275",-[ANNOUNCER 1] Do you think he knew Wilson was dead? -[ANNOUNCER 2] My guess would be yes.
726,1005,"01:09:05,360","01:09:08,779",I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.
727,1006,"01:09:08,863","01:09:12,282",-I think any man would've left the ring that fast. -Do you feel this tragedy...
728,1007,"01:09:12,367","01:09:14,284",is gonna affect the world of boxing?
729,1008,"01:09:14,369","01:09:18,288",A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.

732,1016,"01:10:04,544","01:10:07,045",-How you doing? -Great.

752,1038,"01:11:28,419","01:11:30,837",The radio said he was dead.
753,1039,"01:11:33,633","01:11:35,842","Sorry about that, Floyd."
754,1040,"01:11:37,136","01:11:39,638",What does it feel like?
755,1041,"01:11:39,722","01:11:41,640",What does what feel like?
756,1042,"01:11:41,724","01:11:43,642",Killing a man.

759,1045_1046,"01:11:51,567","01:11:58,490",No. It is a subject I have much interest in.
760,1047,"01:11:58,574","01:12:02,494",You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.
761,1048_1049_1050,"01:12:04,997","01:12:13,797",So? -What does it feel like to kill a man? - I'll tell you what.
762,1051,"01:12:13,881","01:12:17,843",Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there and I'll tell you all about it.
763,1052,"01:12:35,528","01:12:38,780","So, Esmarelda..."
764,1053,"01:12:40,116","01:12:43,493",Villa Lobos    is that Mexican?
765,1054,"01:12:43,578","01:12:46,788","The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian."
766,1055,"01:12:46,873","01:12:50,125","-That's some handle you got there, honey. -Thank you."
767,1056,"01:12:50,209","01:12:52,169",And what is your name?

769,1059_1060_1061,"01:13:01,387","01:13:08,351","So, moving right along, Esmarelda, what is it you want to know?"
770,1062,"01:13:08,477","01:13:13,356",-I want to know what it feels like to kill a man. -I couldn't tell ya.
771,1063,"01:13:19,238","01:13:23,658",I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.
772,1064,"01:13:23,743","01:13:28,330","Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it?"
773,1065,"01:13:32,084","01:13:35,503",I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
774,1066,"01:13:46,515","01:13:48,892",What the fuck'd I tell ya? Huh?
775,1067,"01:13:48,976","01:13:52,896","As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof."
776,1068,"01:13:52,980","01:13:55,190",I know. I know. Unbelievable.
777,1069,"01:13:55,274","01:13:58,693","Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive."
778,1070_1071,"01:13:58,778","01:14:03,198","If he never laced up his gloves, which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive."
779,1073,"01:14:05,284","01:14:08,870","Yeah, well, who gives a fuck? It's over now."
780,1074,"01:14:08,955","01:14:11,873","Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd."
781,1075,"01:14:11,958","01:14:15,627",Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.
782,1076,"01:14:15,711","01:14:18,630",How many bookies did you lay it around on?
783,1077,"01:14:18,714","01:14:21,132",All eight? How long to collect?
784,1078,"01:14:22,802","01:14:25,720","So you'll have it all by tomorrow night? No, I understand."
785,1079,"01:14:25,805","01:14:28,932","A few stragglers aside. Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news."
786,1080,"01:14:29,016","01:14:31,226","That is great news, man."
787,1081,"01:14:31,310","01:14:35,522","Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning."
788,1082,"01:14:35,606","01:14:38,858",It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
789,1083,"01:14:38,943","01:14:40,860","Okay, my brother."
790,1084,"01:14:40,945","01:14:42,904", You're right.
791,1085,"01:14:42,989","01:14:45,282",You're goddamn right.
792,1086,"01:14:45,366","01:14:48,868","All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time."
793,1087,"01:14:48,953","01:14:51,204","Cool, brother."
794,1088,"01:15:06,470","01:15:08,888",$45.60.
795,1089_1090,"01:15:12,476","01:15:17,731","And, uh, here's a little something for the effort. Now..."
796,1091,"01:15:17,815","01:15:21,776","if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say?"
797,1092,"01:15:21,861","01:15:23,778",The truth.
798,1093,"01:15:23,863","01:15:27,365","Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans."
799,1094,"01:15:29,243","01:15:31,619","Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos."
800,1095,"01:15:31,704","01:15:34,247","Buenas noches, Butch."
801,1096_1097,"01:15:45,384","01:15:50,638",Whew. Keep the light off.
802,1098,"01:15:50,723","01:15:53,641","-Is that better, sugar pop? -Oui."
803,1100,"01:15:58,147","01:16:00,065",Hard day at the office?
804,1101,"01:16:00,149","01:16:02,067",Pretty hard.
805,1102,"01:16:02,151","01:16:04,361",Got in a fight.
806,1103,"01:16:04,445","01:16:06,613",Poor baby.
807,1104,"01:16:06,697","01:16:09,240",Can you make spoons?
808,1105,"01:16:09,325","01:16:12,202",You know what? I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
809,1106,"01:16:12,328","01:16:16,247",-I'm stinkin' like a dog over here. -I like the way you stink.
810,1107,"01:16:16,332","01:16:18,750",Let me take this jacket off.
811,1108,"01:16:20,920","01:16:24,464",-I was looking at myself in the mirror. -Uh-huh.
812,1109,"01:16:24,548","01:16:26,466",I wish I had a pot.
813,1110,"01:16:28,260","01:16:32,180",You were looking at yourself in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?
814,1111,"01:16:32,264","01:16:35,183",A pot.  A pot belly.
815,1112,"01:16:35,267","01:16:37,394",Pot bellies are sexy.
816,1113_1114,"01:16:37,478","01:16:41,773","Well, you should be happy     'cause you have one."
817,1115,"01:16:41,857","01:16:45,318","Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot."
818,1116_1117,"01:16:45,403","01:16:51,241","I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did ""Lucky Star."" It's not the same thing."
819,1118,"01:16:51,325","01:16:55,245",I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.
820,1119,"01:16:55,329","01:16:57,247",The difference is huge.
821,1120,"01:16:57,331","01:17:00,750", Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
822,1121_1122,"01:17:00,835","01:17:07,257",No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.
823,1123,"01:17:07,341","01:17:10,427",But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.
824,1124_1125,"01:17:10,511","01:17:20,061","The rest of you is normal    normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass    but with a big, perfectly round pot belly."
825,1126,"01:17:20,146","01:17:23,064","If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small..."
826,1127,"01:17:23,149","01:17:25,066",to accentuate it.
827,1128,"01:17:25,151","01:17:27,569",You think men would find that attractive?
828,1129,"01:17:27,653","01:17:30,822",I don't give a damn what men find attractive.
829,1130,"01:17:30,906","01:17:34,367",It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
830,1131,"01:17:34,452","01:17:36,369",is seldom the same.
831,1133,"01:17:39,790","01:17:43,334","If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it."
832,1134,"01:17:43,461","01:17:46,379",-You'd punch me in the belly? -Right in the belly.
833,1135,"01:17:46,464","01:17:48,339",Ohh! I'd smother you!
834,1136_1137,"01:17:48,466","01:17:54,387",-I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe! - -You'd do that? -Yeah.
835,1138,"01:17:54,472","01:17:56,389",-Promise? -Yeah.
836,1140,"01:17:59,935","01:18:01,853",-Mmm. Mmm. -Mmm.
837,1142_1144,"01:18:04,106","01:18:11,863",Oh.  Did you get everything?
838,1145,"01:18:11,989","01:18:14,949","-Yes, I did. -Good job, Sugar Pop."
839,1146,"01:18:15,034","01:18:16,910",Did everything go as planned?
840,1147_1148,"01:18:17,036","01:18:21,748",-You didn't listen to the    Ow! - You didn't listen to the radio?
841,1149,"01:18:21,832","01:18:25,126",I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?
842,1150,"01:18:25,211","01:18:27,462","I won, all right."
843,1151,"01:18:27,588","01:18:30,548",-Are you still retiring? -Sure am.
844,1152,"01:18:30,633","01:18:33,009",So it all worked out in the finish.
845,1153,"01:18:34,428","01:18:37,847","We're not at the finish yet, baby."
846,1155,"01:18:45,814","01:18:48,691","We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?"
847,1156,"01:18:50,236","01:18:53,196","If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?"
848,1157,"01:18:55,241","01:18:58,201","But they won't find us, will they?"
849,1158,"01:19:01,080","01:19:04,040",Do you still want me to go with you?
850,1159_1161,"01:19:05,584","01:19:18,179",I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance. It's    Say it.
851,1162_1163,"01:19:18,305","01:19:24,102","- -Fabienne, I want you to be with me."
852,1164,"01:19:24,186","01:19:27,188",-Forever? -Forever and ever.
853,1165,"01:19:29,316","01:19:31,276",Do you love me?
854,1166,"01:19:31,360","01:19:33,361","Very, very much."
855,1168,"01:19:39,076","01:19:41,619",-Butch. -Yes?
856,1169,"01:19:43,080","01:19:45,665",Will you give me oral pleasure?
857,1170,"01:19:47,167","01:19:49,127",Will you kiss it?
858,1171,"01:19:51,046","01:19:53,214",But you first.
859,1172,"01:19:53,299","01:19:56,134",-Okay. -Okay.
860,1174_1175,"01:20:06,353","01:20:12,150",Butch. Mon amour. L'aventure commence.
861,1178,"01:20:27,708","01:20:30,084", I think I cracked a rib.
862,1179,"01:20:30,210","01:20:33,588","-Giving me oral pleasure? -No, retard, from the fight."
863,1180,"01:20:33,714","01:20:37,091","-Don't call me ""retard."" - My name  is Fabby."
864,1181,"01:20:37,217","01:20:39,677",-My name is Fabienne! -Stop it.
865,1182_1183,"01:20:39,803","01:20:44,724","-Stop it! -My name is Fabi    Shut up, fuckhead! I hate that mongoloid voice."
866,1184,"01:20:44,808","01:20:47,852","Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry."
867,1185,"01:20:47,978","01:20:50,897",- - I take it back.
868,1186,"01:20:52,900","01:20:55,818","Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip?"
869,1187_1188_1189,"01:20:55,903","01:21:05,328","-Oh, I like that. I like being called a tulip. - ""Tulip"" is much better than ""mongoloid."" I didn't call you a mongoloid. I called you a retard."
870,1190,"01:21:05,412","01:21:07,538",And I took it back.
871,1191,"01:21:07,623","01:21:09,707",- -Butch?
872,1192,"01:21:09,792","01:21:11,668","Yes, lemon pie?"
873,1193,"01:21:11,794","01:21:15,213","-Where are we going to go? -Well, I'm not sure yet."
874,1194,"01:21:15,297","01:21:17,423",Wherever you want.

1172,1655_1656,"01:57:14,079","01:57:20,000","- If he does, what do we do? -Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls, but I don't want it to reach that pitch    Jimmie's a friend."
1173,1657,"01:57:20,085","01:57:23,003",You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.
1174,1658,"01:57:23,088","01:57:25,005",Just tell him not to be abusive.
1175,1659,"01:57:25,090","01:57:27,007",He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
1176,1660,"01:57:27,092","01:57:30,261","Put yourself in his position    It's 8-o'clock in the morning, he just woke up."
1177,1661,"01:57:30,345","01:57:32,263",He wasn't expectin' this shit.
1178,1662,"01:57:32,347","01:57:35,266",We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.
1179,1663,"01:57:35,350","01:57:39,228","If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass."
1180,1664,"01:57:39,354","01:57:43,232","-Hey fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man? -I was dryin' my hands!"
1181,1665,"01:57:43,358","01:57:46,235",-Well you're supposed to wash 'em first! -Well you watched me wash 'em.
1182,1666,"01:57:46,361","01:57:49,905",-I watched you get 'em wet. -I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.
1183,1667,"01:57:49,990","01:57:51,907",Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.
1184,1668_1669,"01:57:51,992","01:57:56,912","I used the same fuckin' soap you did, and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!"
1185,1670,"01:57:56,997","01:57:59,915",What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?
1186,1671,"01:58:00,000","01:58:04,086","It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man!"
1187,1672,"01:58:04,170","01:58:07,590","Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right?"
1188,1673,"01:58:07,674","01:58:12,136","You know I respect you and all. But just don't put me in this position, all right?"
1189,1674,"01:58:12,220","01:58:14,889",All right. Fine. Fine.
1190,1675,"01:58:14,973","01:58:17,892","Ask me nice like that, no problem."
1191,1676,"01:58:17,976","01:58:20,936",Just go handle your friend. Go ahead. I don't care.
1192,1677,"01:58:22,647","01:58:25,524","Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!"
1193,1678,"01:58:25,609","01:58:27,651",This some serious gourmet shit.
1194,1679,"01:58:27,736","01:58:29,695",Me and Vincent would've been satisfied...
1195,1680,"01:58:29,779","01:58:31,697",with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
1196,1681_1682,"01:58:31,781","01:58:36,702",Right?  And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.
1197,1683,"01:58:36,786","01:58:38,829","-What flavor is this? -Knock it off, Julie."
1198,1684,"01:58:38,914","01:58:42,958",-What? -I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.
1199,1685,"01:58:43,043","01:58:45,544",I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is.
1200,1686,"01:58:45,629","01:58:47,504","When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit."
1201,1687,"01:58:47,589","01:58:51,216","I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it."
1202,1688,"01:58:51,301","01:58:55,220",But you know what's on my mind right now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
1203,1689,"01:58:55,305","01:58:57,473",It's the dead nigger in my garage.
1204,1690,"01:58:57,557","01:59:00,976","-Jimmie, don't even worry    -No no no don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question."
1205,1691_1692,"01:59:01,061","01:59:06,231","When you came pulling in here, did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, ""Dead nigger storage""?"
1206,1693,"01:59:06,316","01:59:09,735",-You know I ain't seen no    -Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...
1207,1694,"01:59:09,819","01:59:11,737","that said, ""Dead nigger storage""?"
1208,1695,"01:59:11,821","01:59:14,531",No. I didn't.
1209,1696,"01:59:14,658","01:59:17,534",-You know why you didn't see that sign? - Why?
1210,1697,"01:59:17,619","01:59:22,164","'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!"
1211,1698,"01:59:22,248","01:59:25,167","-Hey Jimmie we're not gonna store the motherfucker    -No no no no no no, don't you fuckin' realize..."
1212,1699,"01:59:25,251","01:59:29,672","that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?"
1213,1700,"01:59:29,756","01:59:32,967",No marriage counselor. No trial separation. I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
1214,1701,"01:59:33,051","01:59:36,387",Okay? And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!
1215,1702,"01:59:36,471","01:59:41,475","Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it."
1216,1703,"01:59:41,559","01:59:43,644","Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you."
1217,1704,"01:59:43,728","01:59:47,648","Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me, Jules! Okay? Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me."
1218,1705,"01:59:47,732","01:59:51,694",There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Is there?
1219,1706,"01:59:54,823","01:59:59,493","Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half."
1220,1707,"01:59:59,577","02:00:02,204",The graveyard shift at the hospital.
1221,1708,"02:00:02,288","02:00:05,791",You gotta make some phone calls? You gotta call some people?
1222,1709,"02:00:05,875","02:00:09,795","Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here."
1223,1710,"02:00:09,879","02:00:12,798",That's Kool and the Gang. We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
1224,1711,"02:00:12,882","02:00:15,801",All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.
1225,1712,"02:00:15,885","02:00:18,804",You're fucking my shit up right now!
1226,1713,"02:00:18,888","02:00:21,974",You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.
1227,1714,"02:00:22,058","02:00:25,561","So just do me that favor, all right? The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going."
1228,1715,"02:00:25,645","02:00:28,564","Well, say she comes home."
1229,1716,"02:00:28,648","02:00:31,066",What do you think she'll do?
1230,1717,"02:00:32,569","02:00:34,987","Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak."
1231,1718,"02:00:35,071","02:00:37,281",That ain't no kinda answer.
1232,1719,"02:00:37,365","02:00:40,409","I mean, you know, I don't. How much? A lot or a little?"
1233,1720,"02:00:40,493","02:00:43,328",You got to appreciate what an explosive element...
1234,1721,"02:00:43,413","02:00:45,330",this Bonnie situation is.
1235,1722,"02:00:45,415","02:00:49,334","She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen..."
1236,1723_1724,"02:00:49,419","02:00:54,506","doing a bunch of gangster shit, there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do."
1237,1726,"02:00:56,676","02:00:58,594","Yeah, I grasp that, Jules."
1238,1727,"02:00:58,678","02:01:01,263",All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.
1239,1728,"02:01:01,347","02:01:04,266",I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs!
1240,1729,"02:01:04,350","02:01:08,270","All I want to hear from your ass is, ""You ain't got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker."
1241,1730_1731,"02:01:08,354","02:01:15,736","Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly."" You ain't got no problem, Jules."
1242,1732,"02:01:15,820","02:01:17,946",I'm on the motherfucker.
1243,1733,"02:01:18,031","02:01:23,077","Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly."
1244,1734,"02:01:23,161","02:01:25,579",You sendin' the Wolf?
1245,1735,"02:01:25,663","02:01:27,831","Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?"
1246,1736,"02:01:27,916","02:01:30,209","Shit, yeah, negro!"
1247,1737,"02:01:30,293","02:01:33,337",That's all you had to say!
1248,1738,"02:01:33,463","02:01:36,632",-        - She the  hysterical type?
1249,1739_1740,"02:01:36,758","02:01:41,845",-When is she due? - Mm-hmm.
1250,1741,"02:01:41,930","02:01:43,847",Give me the principals' names again.
1251,1742,"02:01:43,932","02:01:45,849", Place your bets.
1252,1743,"02:01:46,935","02:01:50,562","-Jules. Mm-hmm. -Cards, please."
1253,1744_1745_1746,"02:01:50,647","02:02:02,658",Vincent. Jimmie. Bonnie. Mm-hmm.
1254,1747,"02:02:08,039","02:02:10,999",It's 30 minutes away. I'll be there in 10.
1255,1750,"02:02:27,976","02:02:30,853","You're... Jimmie, right? This is your house?"
1256,1751,"02:02:30,979","02:02:34,565",-It sure is. -I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
1257,1752,"02:02:34,691","02:02:37,609",-Good. We got one. May I come in?
1258,1753,"02:02:37,694","02:02:39,570","Uh, yeah. Please do."
1259,1754,"02:02:39,654","02:02:43,323",You must be Jules. Which would make you... Vincent.
1260,1755,"02:02:43,408","02:02:45,826","Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen."
1261,1756,"02:02:45,910","02:02:48,829","If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?"
1262,1757,"02:02:48,913","02:02:50,789","Uh, one hundred percent."
1263,1758,"02:02:50,915","02:02:54,835","-Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct? -Uh-huh."
1264,1759,"02:02:54,919","02:02:59,381","I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much."
1265,1760_1761,"02:02:59,507","02:03:07,306","-She wouldn't at that. -That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty."
1266,1762,"02:03:07,390","02:03:11,727","Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it."
1267,1764,"02:03:19,444","02:03:21,361",-Jimmie. -Uh-huh.
1268,1765,"02:03:21,446","02:03:24,823","Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee back there."
1269,1766,"02:03:24,949","02:03:28,410","-Would you make me a cup? -Uh, yeah, sure."
1270,1767,"02:03:29,871","02:03:32,789","Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?"
1271,1768,"02:03:32,874","02:03:35,417","Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar."
1272,1769,"02:03:37,503","02:03:40,923","About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall?"
1273,1770,"02:03:41,007","02:03:44,384",Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?
1274,1771,"02:03:44,510","02:03:47,930","-Aside from how it looks, the car's cool. -Positive?"
1275,1772,"02:03:48,014","02:03:51,391",Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
1276,1773,"02:03:51,517","02:03:55,562","-Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top. -Good enough."
1277,1774,"02:03:55,647","02:03:57,648",Let's go back to the kitchen.
1278,1776,"02:04:03,321","02:04:06,281","-Here you go, Mr. Wolf. -Thank you, Jimmie."
1279,1777_1778,"02:04:11,120","02:04:16,208","Mmm. Okay, first thing. You two."
1280,1779,"02:04:16,292","02:04:19,211","Take the body, stick it in the trunk."
1281,1780_1781,"02:04:19,295","02:04:26,051","Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house that would lead me to believe -in the garage or under the sink you got a  bunch of cleaners or cleansers or shit like that. -Yeah yeah Mr. Wolf, under the sink."
1282,1782,"02:04:26,135","02:04:29,554",Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...
1283,1783,"02:04:29,639","02:04:33,642","and clean the inside of the car    I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast."
1284,1784,"02:04:33,726","02:04:37,646","You need to go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull."
1285,1785,"02:04:37,730","02:04:40,649",Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery.
1286,1786,"02:04:40,733","02:04:43,652",It don't need to be spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.
1287,1787,"02:04:43,736","02:04:48,073",Just give it a good once-over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
1288,1788,"02:04:48,157","02:04:52,244","The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up."
1289,1789,"02:04:52,328","02:04:54,746","Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet."
1290,1790,"02:04:54,831","02:04:57,749","I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads."
1291,1791,"02:04:57,834","02:05:01,461","The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em."
1292,1792,"02:05:01,546","02:05:06,842",We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat  and back seat and floorboards...
1293,1793_1794_1795,"02:05:06,926","02:05:15,767","with quilts and blankets, so if a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last, but at a glance the car will appear to be normal."
1294,1796,"02:05:15,852","02:05:17,894","Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work."
1295,1797,"02:05:17,979","02:05:19,730","""Please"" would be nice."
1296,1798,"02:05:21,190","02:05:24,192","-Come again? -I said, a ""please"" would be nice."
1297,1799,"02:05:26,029","02:05:29,906","Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say please. I'm here to tell you what to do."
1298,1800_1801,"02:05:31,701","02:05:37,122","And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess, you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick."
1299,1802,"02:05:37,206","02:05:41,084","I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen."
1300,1803,"02:05:41,169","02:05:44,463","No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated."
1301,1804,"02:05:44,547","02:05:47,466","Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, okay? I respect you."
1302,1805,"02:05:47,550","02:05:50,385",I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
1303,1806,"02:05:50,470","02:05:53,472","If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor."
1304,1807,"02:05:53,556","02:05:58,185","I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this."
1305,1808,"02:05:58,269","02:06:01,730","So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car."
1306,1809,"02:06:06,235","02:06:09,905","Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right? I can feel your look."
1307,1810,"02:06:12,617","02:06:15,285",It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
1308,1812_1813,"02:06:17,372","02:06:23,835",Green. Nothin' except for the mess inside.
1309,1814,"02:06:26,047","02:06:28,465","Mmm, about 20 minutes."
1310,1815,"02:06:29,967","02:06:31,927",Nobody who'll be missed.
1311,1816,"02:06:33,971","02:06:36,932","You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch."
1312,1817,"02:06:38,017","02:06:39,935","-How we comin', Jimmie? -Uh, pretty good."
1313,1818_1819,"02:06:40,019","02:06:46,691","-I got it all here, but, uh, - -Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something. -Winston, Jimmie, Winston."
1314,1820,"02:06:46,776","02:06:50,278","Okay. You gotta understand something, uh, Winston."
1315,1821,"02:06:50,363","02:06:52,280","Uh    Uh, no, thank you."

1329,1839,"02:08:01,100","02:08:03,518","This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit."
1330,1840_1841,"02:08:03,603","02:08:10,025","Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong, that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?"

1334,1845,"02:08:19,869","02:08:23,455","Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red."
1335,1846,"02:08:23,539","02:08:26,958",I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
1336,1847,"02:08:27,043","02:08:28,919",That's all. I could blow.
1337,1848,"02:08:29,045","02:08:30,962","-Oh, oh, you ready to blow? -Yeah."

1351,1864,"02:09:25,309","02:09:28,228",before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.
1352,1865,"02:09:28,312","02:09:30,814","Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit."
1353,1866,"02:09:30,898","02:09:32,816",Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
1354,1867,"02:09:32,900","02:09:35,318",-You know what you two look like? - What?
1355,1868,"02:09:35,403","02:09:38,822",Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.
1356,1869,"02:09:38,906","02:09:42,284",Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.
1357,1870,"02:09:46,581","02:09:49,040",Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
1358,1871,"02:09:49,125","02:09:53,545","Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit  out front for Otto the garbageman to pick up. You know what I'm sayin'?"
1359,1872,"02:09:53,629","02:09:57,841","Don't worry, we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap."
1360,1873,"02:09:59,302","02:10:01,219","-Vincent. - Okay, gentlemen."

1366,1882_1883,"02:10:36,756","02:10:43,553", Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't have planned this better.
1367,1884_1885,"02:10:43,638","02:10:48,016","You guys look like    What do they look like, Jimmie?"
1368,1886_1887,"02:10:48,142","02:10:55,315","-Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks. - - -Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker."

1370,1889,"02:10:58,194","02:11:00,153",Don't make me beg.
1371,1890,"02:11:03,199","02:11:06,618","Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight."
1372,1891,"02:11:06,702","02:11:10,246",We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
1373,1892,"02:11:10,331","02:11:13,249",Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
1374,1893_1894,"02:11:13,334","02:11:19,297","The place is North Hollywood, so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way."
1375,1895,"02:11:19,382","02:11:22,717","Now, I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me."
1376,1896,"02:11:24,095","02:11:26,054","Vincent, you follow in my Acura."
1377,1897_1898,"02:11:26,138","02:11:33,186","Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws, -nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. -Right."
1378,1899,"02:11:33,312","02:11:36,147",-What did I say? -Don't do shit unless.
1379,1900,"02:11:36,273","02:11:38,566",-Unless what? -Unless you do it first.
1380,1901,"02:11:38,651","02:11:41,027",Spoken like a true prodigy.
1381,1902,"02:11:41,112","02:11:44,531","How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?"
1382,1903,"02:11:44,615","02:11:48,743","Mr. Wolf, look, the gun went off. I don't know why. I'm cool, I promise you."
1383,1904,"02:11:48,828","02:11:51,746","Fair enough. Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up."
1384,1905_1906,"02:11:51,831","02:11:57,293","If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies."
1385,1908,"02:12:01,173","02:12:02,882","Outta my way, Rex."
1386,1909,"02:12:04,427","02:12:06,845",-We cool? -Like it never happened.
1387,1910,"02:12:06,929","02:12:10,682","- All right. -Boys, this is Raquel."
1388,1911,"02:12:10,766","02:12:13,393",Someday all this will be hers.
1389,1912,"02:12:13,477","02:12:16,271","Hi. So, what's with the outfits?"

1396,1921,"02:12:39,086","02:12:41,504","Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids."
1397,1922,"02:12:41,589","02:12:45,508","Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work."
1398,1923,"02:12:45,593","02:12:48,511","Yeah, really. And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf."
1399,1924,"02:12:48,596","02:12:50,513",Call me Winston.
1400,1925_1926,"02:12:52,099","02:12:59,230","-You see that, young lady? Respect. - -Respect for one's elders shows character. -I have character."
1401,1927_1928,"02:12:59,356","02:13:12,869",-Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character. - - -Wanna share a cab?
1402,1929_1930,"02:13:12,995","02:13:20,001",-I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin' breakfast with me? - Cool.
1403,1931,"02:13:24,131","02:13:27,217","I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something."
1404,1932,"02:13:27,343","02:13:30,720","-Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob. -I know that now."
1405,1933,"02:13:30,846","02:13:33,264",-But was he cool or what? -Thank you.
1406,1934,"02:13:33,349","02:13:35,767","Totally fuckin' cool, in control."
1407,1935,"02:13:35,851","02:13:39,854",Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
1408,1936,"02:13:39,980","02:13:42,565",- -Want some bacon?
1409,1937,"02:13:42,650","02:13:44,526","No, man, I don't eat pork."
1410,1938,"02:13:44,652","02:13:48,029","-Are you Jewish? -I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all."
1411,1939,"02:13:48,155","02:13:51,074",-Why not? -Pigs are filthy animals.
1412,1940,"02:13:51,158","02:13:53,076",I don't eat filthy animals.
1413,1941,"02:13:53,060","02:13:56,579","Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good."
1414,1942,"02:13:56,664","02:13:59,582","Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know..."
1415,1943,"02:13:59,667","02:14:02,585",'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.
1416,1944,"02:14:02,610","02:14:05,588",Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal.
1417,1945,"02:14:05,673","02:14:09,551",I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.
1418,1946,"02:14:09,637","02:14:13,972",-How about a dog? Dog eats its own feces. -I don't eat dog either.
1419,1947,"02:14:14,036","02:14:17,392","Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?"
1420,1948_1949,"02:14:17,476","02:14:22,355","I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty."
1421,1950_1951,"02:14:22,481","02:14:30,196","-But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way. -Ah, so, by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal."
1422,1952,"02:14:30,322","02:14:34,242",-Is that true? -We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
1423,1953,"02:14:34,326","02:14:38,329","I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres."
1424,1955,"02:14:43,961","02:14:46,087","Oh, man, that's good."
1425,1956,"02:14:46,171","02:14:49,757","That's good, man. You're startin' to lighten up."
1426,1957,"02:14:49,842","02:14:52,760","You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit."
1427,1958,"02:14:52,887","02:14:55,346","-I just been sittin' here, thinkin'. -About what?"
1428,1959,"02:14:55,431","02:14:58,349",-About the miracle we witnessed. -Miracle you witnessed.
1429,1960,"02:14:58,434","02:15:01,644","-I witnessed a freak occurrence. -What is a miracle, Vincent?"
1430,1961,"02:15:03,606","02:15:06,774",-Act of God. -And what's an act of God?
1431,1962,"02:15:10,279","02:15:14,115","When, um, God makes the impossible possible."
1432,1963,"02:15:15,117","02:15:16,993",But this morning...
1433,1964,"02:15:17,119","02:15:19,829","-I don't think qualifies. -Hey, Vincent."
1434,1965,"02:15:19,914","02:15:23,625","Don't you see, that shit don't matter. You're judging this shit the wrong way."
1435,1966,"02:15:23,709","02:15:28,630","I mean it could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys."
1436,1967,"02:15:28,714","02:15:31,674",You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
1437,1968,"02:15:31,759","02:15:34,218","Now, whether or not what we experienced..."
1438,1969,"02:15:34,303","02:15:37,430",was an According-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.
1439,1970,"02:15:37,514","02:15:41,267","But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God."
1440,1971,"02:15:41,352","02:15:43,269",God got involved.
1441,1972,"02:15:43,354","02:15:45,063",But why?
1442,1973,"02:15:45,147","02:15:48,191","Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why."
1443,1974,"02:15:48,275","02:15:51,235",-But I can't go back to sleep. -You're serious.
1444,1975,"02:15:51,320","02:15:53,154",You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
1445,1976,"02:15:53,280","02:15:55,949",-For life? -Yeah. -Most definitely.
1446,1977,"02:15:56,033","02:15:59,369",Fuck. What you gonna do then?
1447,1978,"02:16:00,704","02:16:04,916","Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating."
1448,1979,"02:16:05,000","02:16:08,586",First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.
1449,1980,"02:16:08,671","02:16:11,756","Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the earth."
1450,1981,"02:16:11,840","02:16:15,259","-What you mean, ""Walk the earth""? -Like Caine in Kung Fu."
1451,1982,"02:16:15,344","02:16:18,304","Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures."
1452,1983,"02:16:18,389","02:16:20,640",And how long do you intend to walk the earth?
1453,1984,"02:16:20,724","02:16:24,018",-'Til God puts me where he wants me to be. -And what if he don't do that?
1454,1985,"02:16:24,103","02:16:29,023","-If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever. -So you decided to be a bum."
1455,1986,"02:16:29,108","02:16:32,735","I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less."
1456,1987_1988_1989,"02:16:32,820","02:16:41,160","No, Jules, you decided to be a bum, just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away."
1457,1990,"02:16:41,245","02:16:44,205","They got a name for that, Jules    It's called a bum."
1458,1991,"02:16:44,289","02:16:47,959","And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man."

1605,2168,"02:27:34,064","02:27:36,982",I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...
1606,2169,"02:27:37,067","02:27:39,485",before I popped a cap in his ass.
1607,2170,"02:27:39,569","02:27:42,988",But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.
1608,2171,"02:27:43,073","02:27:45,991","See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means..."
1609,2172_2173,"02:27:46,076","02:27:53,957","you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man, and Mr. 9-millimeter here, he's the shepherd..."
1610,2174,"02:27:54,042","02:27:57,586",protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness.
1611,2175,"02:27:57,671","02:27:59,588",Or it could mean...
1612,2176_2177,"02:27:59,673","02:28:07,096","you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd, and it's the world that's evil and selfish."
1613,2178,"02:28:07,180","02:28:09,431","Yeah, I'd like that."
1614,2179,"02:28:09,516","02:28:12,393",But that shit ain't the truth.
1615,2180_2181,"02:28:12,477","02:28:17,356","The truth is, you're the weak..."
1616,2182,"02:28:18,733","02:28:22,111",and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
1617,2183,"02:28:23,571","02:28:25,489","But I'm tryin', Ringo."
1618,2184,"02:28:26,741","02:28:29,660",I'm tryin' real hard...
1619,2185,"02:28:29,744","02:28:32,037",to be the shepherd.
1620,2186_2187,"02:28:47,345","02:29:09,324",Go. I think we should be leaving now.
1621,2188,"02:29:09,451","02:29:12,411","       [""SURF RIDER""] Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
