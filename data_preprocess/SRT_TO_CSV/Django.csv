1,"00:04:18,937","00:04:21,624",Who's that stumbling around in the dark?
2,"00:04:22,138","00:04:25,580",State your business or prepare to get winged!
3,"00:04:26,309","00:04:28,787","Calm yourselves, gentlemen."
4,"00:04:28,853","00:04:30,530",I mean you no harm.
5,"00:04:31,356","00:04:34,362",I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
6,"00:04:34,707","00:04:35,889",Oh boy.
7,"00:04:37,678","00:04:39,416","Good cold evening, gentlemen."
8,"00:04:39,457","00:04:41,969",I'm looking for a pair of slave traders
9,"00:04:41,971","00:04:43,846",that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.
10,"00:04:43,989","00:04:45,074",Might that be you?
11,"00:04:46,913","00:04:47,999",Who wants to know?
12,"00:04:48,208","00:04:49,341","Well, I do."
13,"00:04:49,832","00:04:51,980","I'm Dr. King Schultz. This is my horse, Fritz."
14,"00:04:53,684","00:04:54,907",What kinda doctor?
15,"00:04:55,671","00:04:56,597",Dentist.
16,"00:04:57,132","00:04:58,540","Now, are you the Speck Brothers?"
17,"00:04:58,591","00:05:00,133",And did you purchase those men
18,"00:05:00,157","00:05:01,515",at the Greenville slave auction?
19,"00:05:01,552","00:05:02,353",So what?
20,"00:05:02,354","00:05:04,471",So I wish to parley with you.
21,"00:05:04,542","00:05:05,541",Speak English.
22,"00:05:06,214","00:05:07,257",Oh sorry.
23,"00:05:07,809","00:05:10,019",Please forgive me. It is a second language.
24,"00:05:10,186","00:05:13,760","Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe,"
25,"00:05:13,838","00:05:15,914",is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
26,"00:05:16,437","00:05:17,897","Hello, you poor devils!"
27,"00:05:19,028","00:05:22,037",Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident
28,"00:05:22,039","00:05:24,565",of the Carrucan plantation?
29,"00:05:26,014","00:05:27,799",I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
30,"00:05:29,924","00:05:30,803",Who said that?
31,"00:06:18,254","00:06:19,369",What's your name?
32,"00:06:23,801","00:06:24,853",Django.
33,"00:06:26,178","00:06:28,335",Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for.
34,"00:06:30,475","00:06:32,195",Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?
35,"00:06:36,665","00:06:37,666",Who are they?
36,"00:06:39,882","00:06:40,828",Big John.
37,"00:06:42,153","00:06:42,993",Ellis.
38,"00:06:44,906","00:06:45,685",Roger.
39,"00:06:46,097","00:06:47,165",Sometime they call him...
40,"00:06:47,572","00:06:48,623",Lil Raj.
41,"00:06:50,203","00:06:52,328",They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation.
42,"00:06:52,580","00:06:53,664",Not anymore.
43,"00:06:56,837","00:06:57,794",Tell me...
44,"00:06:58,482","00:07:01,454","if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again,"
45,"00:07:01,456","00:07:03,092",would you recognize them? Hey.
46,"00:07:04,284","00:07:05,665",Stop talking to him like that.
47,"00:07:05,864","00:07:06,714",Like What?
48,"00:07:07,296","00:07:08,245",Like that.
49,"00:07:08,568","00:07:11,216","My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain..."
50,"00:07:11,218","00:07:12,394","Speak English, goddamn it."
51,"00:07:13,230","00:07:15,216",Everybody calm down.
52,"00:07:15,276","00:07:16,966","I'm simply a customer,"
53,"00:07:16,967","00:07:19,310",trying to conduct a transaction.
54,"00:07:19,357","00:07:20,219",I don't care.
55,"00:07:20,487","00:07:21,984","No sale. Now, off with you."
56,"00:07:22,966","00:07:25,154",Don't be ridiculous. Of course they're for sale.
57,"00:07:25,879","00:07:26,920",Move it.
58,"00:07:27,805","00:07:28,919","My good man,"
59,"00:07:29,154","00:07:32,661",did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture
60,"00:07:32,663","00:07:36,056",or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?
61,"00:07:37,856","00:07:39,431","Last chance, fancy pants."
62,"00:07:40,878","00:07:42,504","Oh, very well."
63,"00:08:12,340","00:08:14,759","I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,"
64,"00:08:14,793","00:08:16,844",but I didn't want you to do anything rash
65,"00:08:16,846","00:08:18,958",before you had a moment to come to your senses.
66,"00:08:19,743","00:08:22,430",You goddamn son of a bitch!
67,"00:08:22,984","00:08:25,089",You shot Roscoe! Well...
68,"00:08:25,673","00:08:27,161",And you killed Ace!
69,"00:08:27,550","00:08:30,305",I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.
70,"00:08:30,601","00:08:33,222","And I do believe I have... one, two, three, four..."
71,"00:08:33,529","00:08:35,141","five witnesses,"
72,"00:08:35,142","00:08:36,350",who can attest to that fact.
73,"00:08:36,702","00:08:38,357",Damn leg's busted!
74,"00:08:38,444","00:08:39,481",No doubt.
75,"00:08:39,671","00:08:42,597","Now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum,"
76,"00:08:42,599","00:08:45,405",I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
77,"00:08:49,614","00:08:51,689",God-fucking-damn it!
78,"00:08:51,691","00:08:52,662",As I was saying...
79,"00:08:53,413","00:08:55,661","if you were to see the Brittle Brothers,"
80,"00:08:55,662","00:08:57,125",again you could recognize them?
81,"00:08:57,622","00:08:58,489",Yeah.
82,"00:08:59,631","00:09:00,924",Sold American!
83,"00:09:00,958","00:09:02,177","So, Mr. Speck?"
84,"00:09:02,178","00:09:04,579",Mr. Speck? How much for young Django here?
85,"00:09:10,366","00:09:12,595",That iron is nasty business.
86,"00:09:18,222","00:09:19,910","Oh, could you hold this for a moment?"
87,"00:09:22,313","00:09:23,347",Thank you.
88,"00:09:23,348","00:09:24,121",Django?
89,"00:09:24,277","00:09:25,579",Get up on that horse.
90,"00:09:26,278","00:09:27,734","Also, if I were you,"
91,"00:09:28,086","00:09:31,896",I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
92,"00:09:46,128","00:09:46,973",Nigger!
93,"00:09:47,197","00:09:49,683",Don't you touch my brother's coat.
94,"00:10:01,539","00:10:03,035",Goddamn it!
95,"00:10:07,772","00:10:09,098",One hundred...
96,"00:10:09,651","00:10:10,593",ten...
97,"00:10:11,294","00:10:12,320",20...
98,"00:10:12,960","00:10:14,448",and five...
99,"00:10:15,935","00:10:17,102",for young Django here.
100,"00:10:17,233","00:10:19,647","And since he won't be needing it anymore,"
101,"00:10:19,649","00:10:21,835",I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
102,"00:10:22,698","00:10:23,720","Also,"
103,"00:10:23,926","00:10:25,002","Mr. Speck,"
104,"00:10:25,003","00:10:27,545",I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.
105,"00:10:27,712","00:10:28,635",Do you have one?
106,"00:10:29,858","00:10:31,860","You go to hell, dentist."
107,"00:10:32,968","00:10:33,952",I thought not.
108,"00:10:34,930","00:10:35,925",No worries.
109,"00:10:36,678","00:10:37,886",I come prepared.
110,"00:10:42,482","00:10:43,416",Thank you.
111,"00:10:44,429","00:10:46,308","This will serve nicely,"
112,"00:10:46,309","00:10:47,779",as a bill of sale.
113,"00:11:05,609","00:11:08,434","Now, as to you poor devils."
114,"00:11:09,567","00:11:10,850","So, as I see it,"
115,"00:11:11,641","00:11:14,033","when it comes to the subject of what to do next,"
116,"00:11:14,423","00:11:15,908",you gentlemen have...
117,"00:11:15,909","00:11:17,038",two choices.
118,"00:11:17,507","00:11:18,082",One.
119,"00:11:18,730","00:11:19,808","Once I'm gone,"
120,"00:11:20,238","00:11:22,786","you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck,"
121,"00:11:22,788","00:11:24,477",then carry him to the nearest town.
122,"00:11:24,747","00:11:27,937",Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came.
123,"00:11:28,535","00:11:29,340",Or two.
124,"00:11:30,699","00:11:32,327","You could unshackle yourselves,"
125,"00:11:32,998","00:11:34,070","take that rifle,"
126,"00:11:34,394","00:11:35,572","put a bullet in his head,"
127,"00:11:35,768","00:11:37,090","bury the two of them deep,"
128,"00:11:37,262","00:11:40,493",and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country.
129,"00:11:41,694","00:11:42,709",Choice is yours.
130,"00:11:43,591","00:11:47,474","And on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you,"
131,"00:11:47,528","00:11:49,973",the North Star is that one.
132,"00:11:52,055","00:11:52,883",Tada.
133,"00:12:10,044","00:12:11,476","Now wait a minute, fellas."
134,"00:12:11,645","00:12:13,305",Let's talk about this!
135,"00:12:17,613","00:12:20,907",You got to be reasonable in a situation like this!
136,"00:12:22,493","00:12:25,496",I'm not a bad guy. I'm just doing my job!
137,"00:12:25,663","00:12:26,618","Blueberry,"
138,"00:12:27,132","00:12:29,104",didn't I give you my last apple?
139,"00:12:29,660","00:12:30,699","Tell you what, boys."
140,"00:12:30,916","00:12:32,533","Take me to the doc in El Paso,"
141,"00:12:32,877","00:12:34,263",I'll get you your freedom.
142,"00:12:34,903","00:12:36,357","No. No, please..."
143,"00:13:23,846","00:13:25,222","Alright, now."
144,"00:13:25,389","00:13:27,642","I'd like you to take two of these tonight,"
145,"00:13:28,159","00:13:29,485",and then in the morning...
146,"00:13:32,208","00:13:33,558",That's a nigger on a horse.
147,"00:13:59,518","00:14:00,935",What's everybody staring at?
148,"00:14:01,461","00:14:03,481",They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before.
149,"00:14:27,117","00:14:28,861","Good morning, innkeeper!"
150,"00:14:30,698","00:14:32,776",Two beers for two weary travelers.
151,"00:14:32,944","00:14:34,833",It's still a bit early.
152,"00:14:35,191","00:14:37,141",We won't be open for another hour.
153,"00:14:37,797","00:14:39,494","By then, we'll be serving breakfast."
154,"00:14:42,646","00:14:44,906","What the hell you think you're doing, boy?"
155,"00:14:45,177","00:14:46,786",Get that nigger outta here!
156,"00:14:52,270","00:14:54,075",Help! Help!
157,"00:14:54,140","00:14:55,131",Innkeeper!
158,"00:14:55,490","00:14:56,383","Remember,"
159,"00:14:56,384","00:14:58,350","get the sheriff, not the marshal."
160,"00:14:58,710","00:15:00,357",Sheriff! Help!
161,"00:15:00,835","00:15:01,681",Alas.
162,"00:15:03,362","00:15:05,906",Now we must act as our own bartender.
163,"00:15:08,325","00:15:09,873","Sit down, my boy."
164,"00:15:20,019","00:15:21,348",What kind of dentist are you?
165,"00:15:23,465","00:15:28,053","Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years."
166,"00:15:32,987","00:15:35,192","But these days, I practice a new profession..."
167,"00:15:38,461","00:15:39,503",bounty hunter.
168,"00:15:46,374","00:15:47,882",Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
169,"00:15:48,699","00:15:49,413",No.
170,"00:15:49,767","00:15:50,602",Well...
171,"00:15:52,745","00:15:56,874","the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash,"
172,"00:15:57,041","00:15:59,223",a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
173,"00:16:00,713","00:16:01,246",Hat.
174,"00:16:05,507","00:16:06,372",Prost.
175,"00:16:15,428","00:16:18,104",The state places a bounty on a man's head.
176,"00:16:18,187","00:16:21,184","I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man."
177,"00:16:21,186","00:16:25,190","After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities."
178,"00:16:25,575","00:16:27,700",Sometimes that's easier said than done.
179,"00:16:27,905","00:16:30,089","I show that corpse to the authorities,"
180,"00:16:30,090","00:16:32,576","proving yes, indeed, I truly have killed him,"
181,"00:16:32,743","00:16:35,197",at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.
182,"00:16:35,913","00:16:36,465","So,"
183,"00:16:36,926","00:16:39,573","like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business."
184,"00:16:40,876","00:16:41,924",What's a bounty?
185,"00:16:45,673","00:16:47,132",It's like a reward.
186,"00:16:47,798","00:16:48,904",You kill people?
187,"00:16:49,261","00:16:50,399",And they give you a reward?
188,"00:16:51,399","00:16:52,721","Certain people, yeah."
189,"00:16:53,106","00:16:54,058",Bad people?
190,"00:16:55,530","00:16:57,306","Badder they are, bigger the reward."
191,"00:16:58,443","00:16:59,777",Which brings me to you.
192,"00:17:00,771","00:17:03,993","And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you."
193,"00:17:05,431","00:17:07,611","On one hand, I despise slavery."
194,"00:17:07,937","00:17:09,297","On the other hand,"
195,"00:17:10,177","00:17:11,219",I need your help.
196,"00:17:11,221","00:17:13,771","If you're not in a position to refuse, all the better."
197,"00:17:15,425","00:17:16,644","So, for the time being,"
198,"00:17:16,645","00:17:19,522",I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.
199,"00:17:20,541","00:17:21,324","Still,"
200,"00:17:21,810","00:17:22,844","having said that,"
201,"00:17:24,111","00:17:25,118",I feel guilty.
202,"00:17:26,944","00:17:27,740","So,"
203,"00:17:28,766","00:17:32,136",I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.
204,"00:17:39,371","00:17:40,964",I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
205,"00:17:45,785","00:17:47,422","However, at this endeavor,"
206,"00:17:47,496","00:17:49,295","I'm at a slight disadvantage,"
207,"00:17:49,829","00:17:51,877",insofar as I don't know what they look like.
208,"00:17:53,900","00:17:54,902",But you do.
209,"00:17:55,730","00:17:56,452",Don't ya?
210,"00:17:57,019","00:17:58,617",I know what they look like alright.
211,"00:17:59,188","00:17:59,853",Good.
212,"00:18:00,525","00:18:01,982",So here's my agreement.
213,"00:18:02,868","00:18:05,673",You travel with me until we find them. Where we going?
214,"00:18:06,323","00:18:09,139","I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,"
215,"00:18:09,148","00:18:10,423",but I don't know where.
216,"00:18:11,468","00:18:14,059",That means we visit every plantation
217,"00:18:14,060","00:18:15,764",in Gatlinburg till we find them.
218,"00:18:15,846","00:18:17,314","And when we find them,"
219,"00:18:18,338","00:18:19,609","you point them out,"
220,"00:18:19,610","00:18:20,732",and I kill them.
221,"00:18:22,258","00:18:23,300","You do that,"
222,"00:18:24,108","00:18:25,776","I agree to give you your freedom,"
223,"00:18:25,854","00:18:28,365",$25 per Brittle Brother.
224,"00:18:28,366","00:18:29,678",That's $75.
225,"00:18:30,171","00:18:32,242","And as if on cue,"
226,"00:18:32,243","00:18:33,697",here comes the sheriff.
227,"00:18:41,455","00:18:43,090","Ok, boys."
228,"00:18:43,394","00:18:44,484",Fun's over.
229,"00:18:45,862","00:18:46,838",Come on out.
230,"00:18:50,509","00:18:52,066","Alright folks,"
231,"00:18:52,815","00:18:54,176",calm down.
232,"00:18:55,219","00:18:56,670",Go about your business.
233,"00:18:58,123","00:18:59,998",These jokers will be gone soon.
234,"00:19:02,167","00:19:02,987","Now,"
235,"00:19:03,557","00:19:06,675",why you all wanna come into my town and start trouble?
236,"00:19:08,820","00:19:10,768",Scare all these nice people.
237,"00:19:12,248","00:19:14,493","You ain't got nothing better to do,"
238,"00:19:15,184","00:19:18,282",than to come into Bill Sharp's town
239,"00:19:18,422","00:19:20,684",and show your ass?
240,"00:19:29,366","00:19:31,098",What'd you just do to our sheriff?
241,"00:19:44,234","00:19:45,910",Now you can get the marshal.
242,"00:19:48,083","00:19:49,227",Marshal!
243,"00:19:49,313","00:19:50,261",Marshal!
244,"00:19:50,440","00:19:51,648",Should we wait inside?
245,"00:19:51,754","00:19:52,751",Can we just leave?
246,"00:19:52,860","00:19:53,707",After you.
247,"00:19:56,652","00:20:00,168",Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon.
248,"00:20:00,909","00:20:03,236","I want six men, six rifles behind it."
249,"00:20:04,085","00:20:06,326","I want two men, two rifles up on this roof."
250,"00:20:06,446","00:20:08,114","Two men, two rifles on that roof."
251,"00:20:08,792","00:20:10,976",All the barrels aimed at that front door.
252,"00:20:12,225","00:20:14,753",Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street.
253,"00:20:16,091","00:20:17,223",You in the saloon!
254,"00:20:18,692","00:20:21,528",We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that building.
255,"00:20:22,565","00:20:25,029",You got one chance to get out of this alive.
256,"00:20:26,476","00:20:29,164","You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head,"
257,"00:20:29,173","00:20:30,658",and I mean right now.
258,"00:20:32,232","00:20:35,652",Is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?
259,"00:20:36,253","00:20:37,230","Yes, it is."
260,"00:20:37,993","00:20:39,865",This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
261,"00:20:40,274","00:20:42,023","Na wunderbar, marshal."
262,"00:20:42,826","00:20:46,413","I have relieved myself of all weapons,"
263,"00:20:46,979","00:20:49,554","and just as you have instructed,"
264,"00:20:49,789","00:20:52,336",I am ready to step outside
265,"00:20:52,718","00:20:54,162","with my hands,"
266,"00:20:54,163","00:20:56,362",raised above my head.
267,"00:20:57,949","00:21:00,359",I trust as a representative
268,"00:21:00,361","00:21:03,897","of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,"
269,"00:21:04,025","00:21:05,911",I shan't be shot down
270,"00:21:06,060","00:21:09,809",in the street by either you or your deputies
271,"00:21:10,005","00:21:12,648",before I've had my day in court.
272,"00:21:13,119","00:21:14,680",You mean like you did our sheriff.
273,"00:21:15,317","00:21:17,110",Shot him down like a dog in the street.
274,"00:21:17,277","00:21:19,613","Yes, that's exactly what I mean."
275,"00:21:19,780","00:21:21,979","Do I have your word as a lawman,"
276,"00:21:22,061","00:21:25,300",not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?
277,"00:21:28,789","00:21:29,553","Well,"
278,"00:21:29,742","00:21:32,495","much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that,"
279,"00:21:32,497","00:21:35,086",ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.
280,"00:21:36,371","00:21:37,719","Fair enough, marshal."
281,"00:21:37,861","00:21:38,962",Here we come.
282,"00:21:40,925","00:21:43,005",They're a little tense out there.
283,"00:21:43,464","00:21:46,632","So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking."
284,"00:21:48,611","00:21:49,609",Come ahead.
285,"00:21:56,900","00:21:57,994",You unarmed?
286,"00:21:58,318","00:21:59,479","Yes, indeed we are."
287,"00:22:00,779","00:22:01,706","Marshal Tatum,"
288,"00:22:01,761","00:22:04,596","may I address you and your deputies,"
289,"00:22:04,598","00:22:06,579","and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey,"
290,"00:22:06,581","00:22:08,665",as to the incident that just occurred?
291,"00:22:10,080","00:22:11,150",Go on. Thank you.
292,"00:22:12,995","00:22:15,138",My name is Dr. King Schultz.
293,"00:22:15,248","00:22:18,183","Like yourself marshal, I'm a servant of the court."
294,"00:22:18,697","00:22:20,378","The man lying dead in the dirt,"
295,"00:22:20,845","00:22:24,204","who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff,"
296,"00:22:24,509","00:22:26,218","who went by the name of Bill Sharp,"
297,"00:22:26,428","00:22:30,469","is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,"
298,"00:22:31,018","00:22:33,603",with a price on his head of $200.
299,"00:22:33,863","00:22:36,468","Now that's $200, dead or alive."
300,"00:22:37,087","00:22:38,233",The hell you say!
301,"00:22:38,754","00:22:42,260",I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.
302,"00:22:42,768","00:22:44,097","But I'm willing to wager,"
303,"00:22:44,351","00:22:45,836",this man was elected sheriff
304,"00:22:46,277","00:22:48,109",sometime in the past two years?
305,"00:22:49,839","00:22:50,370",Yeah.
306,"00:22:50,537","00:22:52,875","I know this, because three years ago,"
307,"00:22:52,876","00:22:54,888",he was rustling cattle from the B.C.
308,"00:22:54,889","00:22:57,586","Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas."
309,"00:22:58,110","00:22:59,053","Now this,"
310,"00:22:59,347","00:23:00,708","is a warrant,"
311,"00:23:00,985","00:23:03,331","made out by Circuit Court Judge,"
312,"00:23:03,603","00:23:07,085","Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas."
313,"00:23:07,734","00:23:09,262",You're encouraged to wire him.
314,"00:23:09,510","00:23:11,204","He'll back up who I am,"
315,"00:23:11,657","00:23:14,071",and who your dear departed sheriff was.
316,"00:23:22,816","00:23:24,125","In other words marshal,"
317,"00:23:24,852","00:23:26,457",you owe me $200.
318,"00:23:35,248","00:23:36,496",I'll be damned.
319,"00:24:05,086","00:24:07,434","After this Brittle business is behind us,"
320,"00:24:08,879","00:24:10,148","you'll be a free man,"
321,"00:24:10,709","00:24:11,686","with a horse,"
322,"00:24:12,030","00:24:14,203",$75 in your back pocket...
323,"00:24:17,006","00:24:18,291",What's your plan after that?
324,"00:24:20,802","00:24:21,724","Find my wife,"
325,"00:24:23,227","00:24:24,256",and buy her freedom.
326,"00:24:26,790","00:24:27,835","Django,"
327,"00:24:29,105","00:24:31,198",I had no idea you were a married man.
328,"00:24:32,383","00:24:34,307",Do most slaves believe in marriage?
329,"00:24:35,953","00:24:37,166",Me and my wife do.
330,"00:24:38,376","00:24:40,165","Old Man Carrucan didn't, that's why were."
331,"00:24:41,450","00:24:42,271",We run off.
332,"00:24:43,724","00:24:45,032",Django.
333,"00:24:45,902","00:24:47,770","Django, Django."
334,"00:24:48,529","00:24:50,783","You got sand, Django."
335,"00:24:52,214","00:24:53,698",Boy's got sand.
336,"00:24:55,935","00:24:58,806",I got no use for a nigger with sand.
337,"00:25:00,584","00:25:03,671",I want you to burn a runaway R right here on his cheek.
338,"00:25:04,488","00:25:05,531","And the girl, too."
339,"00:25:07,424","00:25:10,140","And I want you to take them to the Greenville auction,"
340,"00:25:10,872","00:25:12,058",and sell them.
341,"00:25:13,054","00:25:14,049",Both of them.
342,"00:25:15,267","00:25:16,486",Separately.
343,"00:25:19,470","00:25:20,471",And this one...
344,"00:25:23,273","00:25:25,424",you will sell him cheap.
345,"00:25:27,944","00:25:29,265",In Greenville...
346,"00:25:32,161","00:25:34,953",there should be some sort of a records office.
347,"00:25:42,268","00:25:43,898",You know when she was sold...
348,"00:25:45,939","00:25:47,959","you know where she came from,"
349,"00:25:49,129","00:25:50,420",and you know her name.
350,"00:25:51,688","00:25:52,732",What is her name?
351,"00:25:53,880","00:25:54,777",Broomhilda.
352,"00:25:56,556","00:25:57,269",What?
353,"00:25:57,922","00:25:59,133",Broom-hilda.
354,"00:26:00,156","00:26:01,249",Broomhilda?
355,"00:26:04,341","00:26:05,463",Were her owners German?
356,"00:26:06,021","00:26:07,067","Yeah, how you know?"
357,"00:26:08,095","00:26:09,856",She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation.
358,"00:26:09,858","00:26:11,116","She was raised by a German mistress,"
359,"00:26:11,210","00:26:12,097",the Von Shafts.
360,"00:26:12,383","00:26:13,747","She speak a little German, too."
361,"00:26:14,491","00:26:15,963",Your wife?
362,"00:26:16,510","00:26:18,565","When she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody"
363,"00:26:18,567","00:26:19,607",to speak German with.
364,"00:26:21,581","00:26:23,456","Well, let me get this straight."
365,"00:26:24,334","00:26:27,133","Your slave wife speaks German,"
366,"00:26:27,134","00:26:28,922",and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
367,"00:26:29,089","00:26:29,849",Yep.
368,"00:26:34,378","00:26:35,971",They call me Hilda.
369,"00:26:53,697","00:26:56,776","When we gain access to these plantations,"
370,"00:26:57,261","00:26:59,050",we'll be putting on an act.
371,"00:27:00,620","00:27:02,940",You'll be playing a character.
372,"00:27:12,294","00:27:12,997",No?
373,"00:27:20,801","00:27:22,152","During the act,"
374,"00:27:22,262","00:27:24,763",you can never break character.
375,"00:27:26,288","00:27:27,292",Do you understand?
376,"00:27:28,356","00:27:29,123",Yeah.
377,"00:27:29,525","00:27:30,900",Don't break character.
378,"00:27:33,396","00:27:36,661",And your character is that of The Valet.
379,"00:27:37,907","00:27:38,837",What that is?
380,"00:27:40,461","00:27:42,223",That's a fancy word for servant.
381,"00:27:42,871","00:27:43,841",Valet?
382,"00:27:45,623","00:27:47,117","And now Django,"
383,"00:27:47,454","00:27:49,752",you may choose your character's costume.
384,"00:27:52,624","00:27:54,459",Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes?
385,"00:27:54,549","00:27:55,732",But of course.
386,"00:28:29,954","00:28:33,634",It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.
387,"00:28:33,822","00:28:36,372",This is my valet. My valet does not walk.
388,"00:28:37,294","00:28:41,164",I said niggers on horses... His name is Django.
389,"00:28:41,214","00:28:42,503",He's a free man.
390,"00:28:42,504","00:28:44,009",He can ride what he pleases.
391,"00:28:44,099","00:28:45,439",Not on my property.
392,"00:28:45,887","00:28:47,560","Not around my niggers, he can't."
393,"00:28:48,444","00:28:49,835","My good sir,"
394,"00:28:50,973","00:28:52,932",perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
395,"00:28:53,400","00:28:55,753",Allow me to unring this bell.
396,"00:28:56,229","00:28:58,161",My name is Dr. King Schultz.
397,"00:28:58,224","00:28:59,864","This is my valet, Django."
398,"00:29:00,031","00:29:02,226","And these are our horses, Tony and Fritz."
399,"00:29:05,995","00:29:06,992",Mr. Bennett?
400,"00:29:07,539","00:29:09,373","I've been led to believe,"
401,"00:29:09,374","00:29:10,905","that you are a gentleman,"
402,"00:29:10,906","00:29:12,289",and a businessman.
403,"00:29:12,446","00:29:16,318",And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee
404,"00:29:16,320","00:29:17,694",to parley with you now.
405,"00:29:19,105","00:29:22,297",I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.

544,"00:37:49,018","00:37:50,519",You sure that's him? Yeah.
545,"00:37:50,834","00:37:52,521",Positive? I don't know.
546,"00:37:52,772","00:37:55,106",You don't know if you're positive? I don't know what positive mean.

554,"00:38:28,526","00:38:30,296","I am Dr. King Schultz,"
555,"00:38:30,326","00:38:31,433",a legal representative
556,"00:38:31,435","00:38:34,541",of the criminal justice system of the United States of America.
557,"00:38:34,564","00:38:35,665","The man to my left,"
558,"00:38:35,666","00:38:38,268",is Django Freeman. He's my deputy.
559,"00:38:39,095","00:38:40,778","In my pocket is a warrant,"
560,"00:38:41,153","00:38:45,523","signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,"
561,"00:38:45,687","00:38:47,558","for the arrest and capture,"
562,"00:38:47,559","00:38:49,270","dead or alive,"
563,"00:38:49,586","00:38:51,450","of John Brittle,"
564,"00:38:51,917","00:38:54,458",Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
565,"00:38:54,625","00:38:56,198",They were going by the name Shaffer.
566,"00:38:58,129","00:39:02,258","You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name, was Brittle."
567,"00:39:02,631","00:39:04,093",These are wanted men.
568,"00:39:04,338","00:39:05,798",The law wants them for murder.
569,"00:39:06,040","00:39:07,285","Now I reiterate,"
570,"00:39:07,697","00:39:10,419","the warrant states dead or alive,"
571,"00:39:10,426","00:39:13,708","so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight,"
572,"00:39:13,963","00:39:17,127",we were operating within our legal boundaries.
573,"00:39:18,232","00:39:19,389","I realize,"
574,"00:39:20,127","00:39:21,843","passions are high,"
575,"00:39:23,019","00:39:24,469","but I must warn you,"
576,"00:39:25,103","00:39:27,163",the penalty for taking deadly force
577,"00:39:27,165","00:39:30,390",against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty is...
578,"00:39:30,976","00:39:33,017",you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead.
579,"00:39:36,856","00:39:41,006","Now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?"
580,"00:39:43,299","00:39:44,122",Gve me.
581,"00:40:00,983","00:40:02,137",Satisfied?
582,"00:40:09,167","00:40:10,648","May I have that back, please?"
583,"00:40:16,832","00:40:17,793",Get off my land.
584,"00:40:18,458","00:40:19,575",Posthaste.
585,"00:40:20,650","00:40:23,517",Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
586,"00:40:23,518","00:40:24,813",and let's get outta here.
587,"00:40:50,783","00:40:51,775","Yeah,"
588,"00:40:52,463","00:40:54,072",that's them sons-a-bitches.
589,"00:41:34,326","00:41:35,578","Come on, men!"
590,"00:41:37,788","00:41:39,607","We're coming for you, nigger!"
591,"00:41:50,669","00:41:52,455","Now, unless they start shooting first,"
592,"00:41:53,491","00:41:54,571",nobody shoot them.
593,"00:41:55,565","00:41:57,488",That's way too simple for these jokers.
594,"00:41:58,247","00:42:00,820",We're gonna whup that nigger-lover to death.
595,"00:42:01,117","00:42:05,231",And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.
596,"00:42:09,910","00:42:10,618",Damn.
597,"00:42:12,414","00:42:14,704",I can't see fucking shit outta this thing.

601,"00:42:23,056","00:42:24,734",I just made it worse.
602,"00:42:24,793","00:42:26,935",Who made this goddamn shit?
603,"00:42:27,004","00:42:28,101",Willard's wife.
604,"00:42:28,102","00:42:29,965","Well, make your own goddamn masks!"
605,"00:42:30,132","00:42:30,792","Look,"
606,"00:42:30,938","00:42:33,771",nobody's saying they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
607,"00:42:33,773","00:42:36,359","Well, if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,"
608,"00:42:36,639","00:42:38,555",I coulda cut it better than this!
609,"00:42:38,567","00:42:39,854","What about you, Robert?"
610,"00:42:39,855","00:42:40,910",Can you see?
611,"00:42:41,435","00:42:42,645",Not too good.
612,"00:42:42,728","00:42:43,595","I mean,"
613,"00:42:43,811","00:42:46,275","if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good,"
614,"00:42:46,345","00:42:47,235",more or less.
615,"00:42:47,316","00:42:49,599","But when I start riding, the bag's moving all over,"
616,"00:42:49,600","00:42:50,819",and I'm riding blind.
617,"00:42:51,220","00:42:52,105",Shit. Yeah.
618,"00:42:53,637","00:42:55,222",I just made mine worse.
619,"00:42:56,116","00:42:57,314","Oh, God."
620,"00:42:57,409","00:42:58,953",Anybody bring any extra bags?
621,"00:42:59,017","00:42:59,741",No!
622,"00:42:59,845","00:43:02,081",Nobody brought an extra bag.
623,"00:43:02,478","00:43:04,015",I'm just asking.
624,"00:43:04,041","00:43:05,999",Do we have to wear them when we ride?
625,"00:43:06,071","00:43:07,428","Oh, well, shitfire!"
626,"00:43:07,543","00:43:10,629","If you don't wear them as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose!"
627,"00:43:10,631","00:43:12,474","Well, I can't see in this fucking thing!"
628,"00:43:12,758","00:43:15,626",I can't breathe in this fucking thing and I can't ride in this fucking thing!
629,"00:43:15,636","00:43:17,736","Well, fuck all you all! I'm going home!"
630,"00:43:18,300","00:43:22,256","Now, I watched my wife work all day getting 30 bags together"
631,"00:43:22,293","00:43:24,295","for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,"
632,"00:43:24,501","00:43:27,809","and all I can hear is criticize, criticize, criticize!"
633,"00:43:28,274","00:43:29,256","From now on,"
634,"00:43:29,370","00:43:31,443",don't ask me or mine for nothing!
635,"00:43:32,736","00:43:33,627","Now look,"
636,"00:43:34,154","00:43:35,777",let's not forget why we're here.
637,"00:43:35,946","00:43:38,490",We got a killer nigger over that hill there!
638,"00:43:39,127","00:43:40,462",And we got to make a lesson out of him.
639,"00:43:40,536","00:43:41,911","Ok, I'm confused."
640,"00:43:42,160","00:43:43,810",Are the bags on or off?
641,"00:43:44,791","00:43:45,889","I think,"
642,"00:43:46,318","00:43:47,536","we all think,"
643,"00:43:47,918","00:43:49,568",the bag was a nice idea.
644,"00:43:49,701","00:43:50,462",Yeah.
645,"00:43:50,839","00:43:52,534","But, not pointing any fingers,"
646,"00:43:53,415","00:43:54,717",they coulda been done better.
647,"00:43:56,039","00:43:57,200","So, how about..."
648,"00:43:57,605","00:43:59,080","no bags this time,"
649,"00:43:59,720","00:44:00,859","but next time,"
650,"00:44:01,231","00:44:02,410","we do the bags right,"
651,"00:44:02,548","00:44:03,798","and then we go,"
652,"00:44:03,799","00:44:04,725",full regalia.
653,"00:44:04,727","00:44:07,180","I like that idea a lot. You get my vote, Robert."
654,"00:44:07,182","00:44:08,079",Wait a minute!
655,"00:44:08,611","00:44:10,093",I didn't say no bags.
656,"00:44:10,700","00:44:12,161",But nobody can see.
657,"00:44:12,947","00:44:13,761",So?
658,"00:44:13,980","00:44:15,696",So it'd be nice to see.
659,"00:44:16,238","00:44:17,398",Goddamn it!
660,"00:44:17,511","00:44:18,592",This is a raid!
661,"00:44:18,900","00:44:20,891","I can't see, you can't see!"
662,"00:44:21,125","00:44:21,967",So what?
663,"00:44:22,170","00:44:24,357",All that matters is can the fucking horse see!
664,"00:44:24,823","00:44:25,863",That's a raid!
665,"00:44:28,250","00:44:29,657",Sons of bitches!
666,"00:44:29,918","00:44:31,331",I can't see shit!
667,"00:44:31,795","00:44:33,073",There he is!
668,"00:44:33,399","00:44:35,649",Get that nigger out from under that wagon!
669,"00:44:36,443","00:44:38,260",And get that nigger lover outta the wagon!
670,"00:44:38,380","00:44:40,261","That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy!"
671,"00:44:40,290","00:44:41,708",What? They tricked us!
672,"00:44:41,805","00:44:42,848","Well, where are they?"
673,"00:44:43,015","00:44:44,308",Auf Wiedersehen.
674,"00:44:52,107","00:44:53,150",Bull's-eye.
675,"00:44:56,153","00:44:57,216",Look at them run.
676,"00:45:02,171","00:45:04,382","Yeah, cowards tend to do that."
677,"00:45:04,828","00:45:06,600",Goddamn it!
678,"00:45:12,920","00:45:14,171",Goddamn it!
679,"00:45:18,801","00:45:19,902",Would you care to?
680,"00:45:27,309","00:45:28,806",Can't see shit outta this!
681,"00:45:29,668","00:45:31,685",He's getting away. I got him.
682,"00:45:33,982","00:45:35,508",Big Daddy's getting away.
683,"00:45:35,609","00:45:36,576",I got him.
684,"00:45:52,126","00:45:52,991",Got him.
685,"00:45:59,173","00:46:00,678",The kid's a natural.
686,"00:46:11,900","00:46:13,927",How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German?
687,"00:46:15,814","00:46:17,352",Broomhilda is a German name.
688,"00:46:18,068","00:46:20,455","If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German."
689,"00:46:21,242","00:46:23,014",Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda?
690,"00:46:23,834","00:46:25,026","Broomhilda,"
691,"00:46:25,351","00:46:26,990",is the name of a character
692,"00:46:27,119","00:46:28,275","in the most,"
693,"00:46:28,276","00:46:30,525",popular of all the German legends.
694,"00:46:31,370","00:46:32,637",There's a story about Broomhilda?
695,"00:46:33,333","00:46:34,439","Oh, yes, there is."
696,"00:46:41,246","00:46:42,147",Do you know it?
697,"00:46:42,515","00:46:44,318","Oh, every German knows that story."
698,"00:46:50,976","00:46:52,352",Would you like me to tell you?
699,"00:46:53,972","00:46:54,668","Well,"
700,"00:46:56,035","00:46:56,959","Broomhilda,"
701,"00:46:57,287","00:46:58,160",was a...
702,"00:46:58,785","00:46:59,835",princess.
703,"00:47:01,695","00:47:03,503","She was a daughter of Wotan,"
704,"00:47:04,222","00:47:05,733",god of all gods.
705,"00:47:06,825","00:47:07,703","Anyway,"
706,"00:47:07,940","00:47:10,037",her father is really mad at her.
707,"00:47:10,204","00:47:11,189",What she do?
708,"00:47:12,531","00:47:13,991",I can't exactly remember.
709,"00:47:14,041","00:47:16,236",She disobeys him in some way.
710,"00:47:16,877","00:47:19,863",So he puts her on top of the mountain.
711,"00:47:20,714","00:47:21,840",Broomhilda's on a mountain?
712,"00:47:22,007","00:47:23,414","It's a German legend,"
713,"00:47:23,416","00:47:25,817",there is always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.
714,"00:47:26,386","00:47:30,114",And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
715,"00:47:32,100","00:47:34,253","And he surrounds her,"
716,"00:47:34,933","00:47:36,890",in a circle of hellfire.
717,"00:47:38,649","00:47:39,719","And there,"
718,"00:47:40,782","00:47:42,662",Broomhilda shall remain.
719,"00:47:44,279","00:47:45,549","Unless,"
720,"00:47:45,808","00:47:49,339",a hero arises brave enough to save her.
721,"00:47:50,661","00:47:51,886",Does a fella arise?
722,"00:47:52,412","00:47:53,695","Yes Django,"
723,"00:47:53,696","00:47:55,234",as a matter of fact he does.
724,"00:47:55,541","00:47:57,584",A fella named Siegfried.
725,"00:47:58,293","00:47:59,571",Does Siegfried save her?
726,"00:48:01,971","00:48:03,812",Quite spectacularly so.
727,"00:48:05,133","00:48:06,843","He scales the mountain,"
728,"00:48:07,517","00:48:09,263",because he's not afraid of it.
729,"00:48:10,103","00:48:11,418","He slays the dragon,"
730,"00:48:11,889","00:48:13,483",because he's not afraid of him.
731,"00:48:14,445","00:48:16,578",And he walks through hellfire...
732,"00:48:19,280","00:48:20,993",because Broomhilda's worth it.
733,"00:48:25,654","00:48:26,925",I know how he feel.
734,"00:48:28,782","00:48:31,183",I think I'm just starting to realize that.
735,"00:48:37,165","00:48:37,899","Now,"
736,"00:48:38,532","00:48:39,284","look,"
737,"00:48:40,284","00:48:41,026",Django...
738,"00:48:44,411","00:48:47,981",I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...
739,"00:48:49,225","00:48:52,561",but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience.
740,"00:48:54,222","00:48:56,504",A slave auction town in Mississippi
741,"00:48:56,505","00:48:58,229",isn't the place for you to visit.
742,"00:48:58,687","00:48:59,833","Free or not,"
743,"00:48:59,835","00:49:01,183",it's just too dangerous.
744,"00:49:04,682","00:49:06,225",But let me ask you a question.
745,"00:49:14,202","00:49:16,208",How do you like the bounty hunting business?
746,"00:49:18,333","00:49:20,044",Kill white folks and they pay you for it?
747,"00:49:21,410","00:49:22,365",What's not to like?
748,"00:49:22,794","00:49:24,970","Now I have to admit, we make a good team."
749,"00:49:25,535","00:49:27,930",I thought you was mad at me for killing Big John and Lil Raj.
750,"00:49:28,375","00:49:30,727","Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous,"
751,"00:49:30,729","00:49:32,140","but normally, that's a good thing."
752,"00:49:33,473","00:49:35,684",How'd you like to partner up for the winter?
753,"00:49:35,985","00:49:37,113",What you mean partner up?
754,"00:49:38,186","00:49:41,721",You work with me through the winter till the snow melts...
755,"00:49:43,332","00:49:45,483",I give you a third of my bounties.
756,"00:49:46,443","00:49:48,519","So we make some money this winter,"
757,"00:49:48,629","00:49:50,144","and when the snow melts,"
758,"00:49:50,977","00:49:53,037","I'll take you to Greenville myself,"
759,"00:49:53,818","00:49:56,388",and we'll find where they sent your wife.
760,"00:50:01,083","00:50:02,586",Why you care what happen to me?
761,"00:50:04,703","00:50:06,140",Why you care if I find my wife?
762,"00:50:06,713","00:50:07,671",Frankly...
763,"00:50:09,796","00:50:12,260",I've never given anybody their freedom before.
764,"00:50:12,473","00:50:13,710","And now that I have,"
765,"00:50:13,711","00:50:16,033",I feel vaguely responsible for you.
766,"00:50:17,516","00:50:20,765","Plus when a German meets a real life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal."
767,"00:50:23,772","00:50:26,876","As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest"
768,"00:50:26,887","00:50:28,952",to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
769,"00:52:38,794","00:52:39,795",You got her.
770,"00:52:47,840","00:52:50,795",What happened to Mr. I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money?
771,"00:52:51,628","00:52:52,889",His son's with him.
772,"00:52:53,218","00:52:54,132","Well, good."
773,"00:52:54,669","00:52:56,055",He'll have a loved one with him.
774,"00:52:56,375","00:52:58,430",Maybe even share a last word.
775,"00:53:00,762","00:53:02,623",That's better than most of them get.
776,"00:53:02,973","00:53:04,754",Damn sight better than he deserves.
777,"00:53:13,333","00:53:14,551",Put down the rifle.
778,"00:53:17,521","00:53:19,040","Don't worry, I'm not mad at you."
779,"00:53:20,156","00:53:22,491",Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
780,"00:53:26,580","00:53:27,885",Read it aloud.
781,"00:53:28,957","00:53:30,750",Consider that today's lesson.
782,"00:53:33,278","00:53:35,483",Wanted. Dead or alive.

791,"00:53:57,180","00:53:58,564",for Smitty Bacall.
792,"00:53:58,945","00:53:59,793",One...

797,"00:54:09,748","00:54:14,004",Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as follas.
798,"00:54:14,449","00:54:16,006",Follows. Follows.

802,"00:54:24,220","00:54:25,239",That is...
803,"00:54:25,489","00:54:26,577",who Smitty Bacall is.
804,"00:54:27,164","00:54:29,818","If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22,"
805,"00:54:29,934","00:54:31,744",they would never have printed that.
806,"00:54:32,354","00:54:35,774",But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches
807,"00:54:36,253","00:54:38,466",and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
808,"00:54:39,331","00:54:40,894","Do you want to save your wife,"
809,"00:54:41,137","00:54:42,414",by doing what I do?
810,"00:54:43,779","00:54:44,955",This is what I do.
811,"00:54:45,381","00:54:46,582","I kill people,"
812,"00:54:46,583","00:54:48,570",and sell their corpses for cash.
813,"00:54:49,855","00:54:52,800","This corpse is worth $7,000."
814,"00:54:53,667","00:54:55,766",Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him.
815,"00:55:06,012","00:55:06,762",Pa?
816,"00:55:07,648","00:55:08,424",Pa!
817,"00:55:17,357","00:55:18,331",Here.
818,"00:55:19,234","00:55:21,319",You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.
819,"00:55:21,486","00:55:22,061",Why?
820,"00:55:22,357","00:55:23,388",It's good luck.
821,"00:55:23,738","00:55:26,024",You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.
822,"00:56:14,456","00:56:16,006",That's accurate.
823,"00:57:24,192","00:57:25,761","Doctor, Django,"
824,"00:57:25,763","00:57:26,994",how the hell are you?
825,"00:57:28,556","00:57:30,095",Who the hell-a you got there?
826,"00:57:30,863","00:57:32,453",The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
827,"00:57:33,085","00:57:35,701",Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
828,"00:57:36,762","00:57:39,472",Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe
829,"00:57:39,773","00:57:41,044",and three of their acolytes.
830,"00:57:42,808","00:57:45,089","Well, just leave them out here, they ain't going nowhere."
831,"00:57:45,308","00:57:47,524",Why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow
832,"00:57:47,723","00:57:49,021",and get yourselves some coffee.
833,"00:57:49,592","00:57:52,137",We had a birthday yesterday. Got some cake.
834,"00:57:52,591","00:57:53,636",Pretty good.
835,"00:58:27,172","00:58:28,423",Keep moving.
836,"00:58:28,590","00:58:30,550",Get on up on that auction block.
837,"00:58:32,093","00:58:34,470",Don't let that mud slow you down. Keep going.
838,"00:58:50,904","00:58:52,155",Keep going!

841,"00:58:58,703","00:59:00,121",'R' on right cheek.
842,"00:59:01,927","00:59:04,042",Calvin Candie.
843,"00:59:04,302","00:59:07,565",He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi.
844,"00:59:07,566","00:59:08,723",Candyland.
845,"00:59:09,015","00:59:09,980",Candyland?
846,"00:59:10,518","00:59:11,602","Oh, so you've heard of it."
847,"00:59:11,642","00:59:13,316",Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
848,"00:59:13,801","00:59:16,163","Well apparently, that's where your wife is..."
849,"00:59:16,638","00:59:19,182",and that's the repellant gentleman who owns her.
850,"00:59:19,613","00:59:22,043","Let's just hope she works in the house, not in the field."
851,"00:59:22,294","00:59:23,663","Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger."
852,"00:59:24,479","00:59:26,175",She... She pretty.
853,"00:59:27,335","00:59:28,787","And she talk good, too."
854,"00:59:30,652","00:59:32,493",But when they tore her back up and then they...
855,"00:59:33,834","00:59:35,439",burned that runaway r on her cheek...
856,"00:59:37,242","00:59:38,409",they goddamned her.
857,"00:59:43,122","00:59:44,828",She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough
858,"00:59:44,830","00:59:46,016",for the house no more either.
859,"00:59:46,834","00:59:48,399",They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.
860,"00:59:48,497","00:59:49,469",What's a comfort?
861,"00:59:51,089","00:59:52,516",Not while I got freedom.
862,"00:59:53,967","00:59:55,440",Not while I got my gun.
863,"00:59:58,846","01:00:00,360",So do we offer to buy her?
864,"01:00:03,340","01:00:04,334",So...
865,"01:00:06,339","01:00:07,224",say...
866,"01:00:09,983","01:00:10,990","a man,"
867,"01:00:11,271","01:00:12,680",wants to buy a horse.
868,"01:00:13,243","01:00:14,884",Needs to buy a horse.
869,"01:00:16,529","01:00:18,094","He walks up to the farmer's farm,"
870,"01:00:18,110","01:00:19,490",and he knocks on the farmer's door
871,"01:00:19,492","01:00:21,395",and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
872,"01:00:21,397","01:00:23,191",And do you know what the farmer says?
873,"01:00:23,288","01:00:25,239","The farmer says, no."
874,"01:00:27,115","01:00:29,354","Well, I say fuck that farmer,"
875,"01:00:29,986","01:00:31,358",and I'm stealing that horse.
876,"01:00:32,130","01:00:34,744","Fair enough. But now you're a horse thief,"
877,"01:00:34,745","01:00:36,385",and they hang horse thieves.
878,"01:00:36,591","01:00:38,852","Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner,"
879,"01:00:38,854","01:00:40,511",because the horse is still his property.
880,"01:00:40,778","01:00:41,867","We need her,"
881,"01:00:42,235","01:00:43,073",and...
882,"01:00:43,321","01:00:44,407",we need a bill of sale.
883,"01:00:44,559","01:00:46,512","Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her, then how we gonna get her?"
884,"01:00:48,183","01:00:51,609",May I offer an alternative plan of action?
885,"01:00:51,777","01:00:52,872",Go ahead.
886,"01:00:53,659","01:00:54,202",So...
887,"01:00:55,455","01:00:56,484","the man,"
888,"01:00:56,784","01:00:58,185","walks up to the farmer's farm,"
889,"01:00:58,235","01:00:59,778",he knocks on the farmer's door...
890,"01:01:00,540","01:01:02,065","and asks,"
891,"01:01:02,066","01:01:03,592","not to buy the horse,"
892,"01:01:04,112","01:01:05,536",but the farm.
893,"01:01:05,538","01:01:09,334","And makes an offer so ridiculous,"
894,"01:01:09,481","01:01:12,025",the farmer is forced to say yes.
895,"01:01:12,878","01:01:14,675",We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
896,"01:01:14,676","01:01:15,822","No, it's far too big."
897,"01:01:15,907","01:01:18,715",But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm.
898,"01:01:20,667","01:01:22,711",How much do you know about Mandingo fighting?
899,"01:01:22,753","01:01:23,427",What?
900,"01:01:23,835","01:01:26,914",Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
901,"01:01:26,916","01:01:28,809",who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
902,"01:01:28,840","01:01:29,548",Why?
903,"01:01:30,204","01:01:31,641",Because my character
904,"01:01:31,642","01:01:34,006","is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,"
905,"01:01:34,009","01:01:35,851",here in Greenville to buy my way
906,"01:01:35,887","01:01:37,273",into the Mandingo fight game.
907,"01:01:37,430","01:01:38,914",And your character
908,"01:01:38,953","01:01:41,361",is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.
909,"01:01:41,445","01:01:42,995",They call that One-Eyed Charley.
910,"01:01:46,597","01:01:47,713","Bonjour. <font color=""#00ffff""><i>Good morning</i></font>"

915,"01:01:58,049","01:01:59,509",Thank you.
916,"01:02:00,551","01:02:02,462",You want me to play a black slaver?
917,"01:02:03,570","01:02:05,357",Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.
918,"01:02:06,337","01:02:09,252",A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...
919,"01:02:10,443","01:02:12,146","and buddy, that's pretty fucking low."
920,"01:02:13,791","01:02:15,675",Then play him that way.
921,"01:02:15,733","01:02:17,574",Give me your...
922,"01:02:17,887","01:02:19,730",black slaver.
923,"01:02:22,448","01:02:25,892",â™ª <i>Along came the 219. Toot! Toot!</i> â™ª

925,"01:02:31,165","01:02:32,881",Dr. Schultz!
926,"01:02:33,209","01:02:34,856",Good to see you again!
927,"01:02:34,857","01:02:36,421",Mr. Moguy.
928,"01:02:36,519","01:02:39,653",Thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity
929,"01:02:39,690","01:02:41,989","for this appointment. Nonsense, it's my job."
930,"01:02:42,611","01:02:45,558",So this is the One-Eyed Charley I've heard so much about.
931,"01:02:45,560","01:02:47,858","Yes, this is Django Freeman."
932,"01:02:48,245","01:02:50,902","Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy."
933,"01:02:51,088","01:02:52,638",Just call me Leo.
934,"01:02:53,062","01:02:56,113",Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room. You all wanna follow me?
935,"01:02:56,704","01:02:58,998",How long have you been associated with Mr. Candie?
936,"01:02:59,612","01:03:01,168",Calvin's father and I were about...
937,"01:03:01,194","01:03:03,157",11 when we went to boarding school together.
938,"01:03:03,575","01:03:06,468",Calvin's father's father put me through law school.
939,"01:03:06,701","01:03:09,704",One could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
940,"01:03:09,871","01:03:11,471",One could almost say youse a nigger.
941,"01:03:12,631","01:03:13,601",What did you say?
942,"01:03:14,286","01:03:17,039","I said... Nothing, he's just being cheeky."
943,"01:03:17,543","01:03:21,964",Anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him?
944,"01:03:21,966","01:03:24,239","Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile."
945,"01:03:24,553","01:03:26,044",What civilized people aren't?
946,"01:03:26,095","01:03:28,600",And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mr. Candie.
947,"01:03:28,603","01:03:30,751","Si c'est cela qu'il prefere. <font color=""#00ffff""><i>Whatever he prefers.</i></font>"
948,"01:03:30,771","01:03:32,323",He doesn't speak French.
949,"01:03:32,351","01:03:34,705","Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him."
950,"01:03:38,065","01:03:40,318","Get back on top, now! Turn around!"
951,"01:03:40,485","01:03:41,779",There you go.
952,"01:03:42,356","01:03:43,456",There you go.
953,"01:03:45,734","01:03:48,123",Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business?
954,"01:03:50,745","01:03:54,252",You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?
955,"01:03:55,497","01:03:56,699","Quit stalling, now."
956,"01:03:57,461","01:03:58,628",Answer the question.
957,"01:04:01,297","01:04:02,370",The awful truth?
958,"01:04:03,278","01:04:04,357",I'm bored.
959,"01:04:04,991","01:04:06,679",This seems like a good bit of fun.
960,"01:04:12,183","01:04:14,185","Well, come on over."
961,"01:04:14,352","01:04:17,063",We got us a fight going on that's a good bit of fun.
962,"01:04:21,108","01:04:22,865",Won't you accompany me to the bar?
963,"01:04:31,577","01:04:33,360","You don't wear a hat in the house, white man."
964,"01:04:33,362","01:04:34,344",Even I know that.
965,"01:04:43,235","01:04:45,038",Dr. Schultz. What a rare pleasure.
966,"01:04:45,040","01:04:46,173","Keep fighting, niggers."
967,"01:04:46,789","01:04:48,239","And I might add, an honor."
968,"01:04:48,724","01:04:49,707",Honor to meet you.
969,"01:04:49,709","01:04:51,760","Please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine."
970,"01:04:51,762","01:04:54,323",Get free man Django here whatever he wants.
971,"01:04:55,268","01:04:57,365",And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
972,"01:05:17,206","01:05:18,969","Use your weight boy, use your weight!"
973,"01:05:18,970","01:05:20,081",There you go.
974,"01:05:20,683","01:05:22,529",He's much bigger and stronger!
975,"01:05:23,151","01:05:24,182","Come on, now!"
976,"01:05:24,589","01:05:27,446","He's not doing what I told him, for God's sakes."
977,"01:05:28,200","01:05:29,488","Bravo Luigi, cosÃ¬ e dai. <font color=""#00ffff""><i>Good Luigi, go on.</i></font>"
978,"01:05:29,778","01:05:31,034","Devi essere piÃ¹ rapido. <font color=""#00ffff""><i>Be more faster.</i></font>"
979,"01:05:31,178","01:05:33,897","Come on, now, boy! It's a fight to the death!"
980,"01:05:35,443","01:05:37,494",You either hit him or are you ain't?
981,"01:05:41,907","01:05:43,256","Ecco I con la spola tappeto. <font color=""#00ffff""><i>Make the carpet shuttle.</i></font>"
982,"01:05:43,346","01:05:44,724","La spola tappeto giÃ¹! <font color=""#00ffff""><i>The carpet down!</i></font>"
983,"01:05:45,506","01:05:47,303","Big Fred, come on!"
984,"01:05:48,487","01:05:50,171",Turn him around! Now...
985,"01:05:53,826","01:05:55,600","Use your strength, boy!"
986,"01:05:56,167","01:05:58,164","Come on, now! Use your strength!"
987,"01:06:00,249","01:06:01,303",There you go!
988,"01:06:03,377","01:06:04,480",There you go!
989,"01:06:04,840","01:06:05,931",Look at that.
990,"01:06:06,995","01:06:09,104","See, I told you to put some more power in there."
991,"01:06:09,848","01:06:11,640","Do what I told you, boy!"
992,"01:06:12,347","01:06:13,433",There you go!
993,"01:06:13,973","01:06:16,267",No! Do what I told ya!
994,"01:06:16,349","01:06:19,393","Blind him black, boy! Blind him black!"
995,"01:06:21,729","01:06:23,401","Oh, no, Luigi."
996,"01:06:43,793","01:06:44,953",Finish him.
997,"01:06:49,686","01:06:50,943","Go on, boy, finish him!"

1057,"01:10:07,371","01:10:10,236","Now I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience,"
1058,"01:10:10,238","01:10:12,240",it would be to discuss business.
1059,"01:10:15,456","01:10:17,053","Well, we weren't talking business yet."
1060,"01:10:17,884","01:10:19,607",We were discussing my curiosity.
1061,"01:10:22,428","01:10:23,287",Thank you.

1074,"01:10:47,481","01:10:50,286","Well, you don't make it sound too flattering,"
1075,"01:10:50,288","01:10:51,518","but more or less, yeah."
1076,"01:10:53,792","01:10:54,606",So...

1079,"01:10:59,373","01:11:01,001",and you was none too impressed?
1080,"01:11:01,508","01:11:02,823",Not for top dollar.
1081,"01:11:05,343","01:11:07,222","Well, then, we got nothing more to talk about."
1082,"01:11:07,505","01:11:09,632","You see, you wanna buy a beat-ass nigger from me,"
1083,"01:11:09,768","01:11:12,156",those are the beat-ass niggers I wanna sell so...
1084,"01:11:12,203","01:11:14,238",He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.
1085,"01:11:15,022","01:11:16,197","He wants the nigger,"
1086,"01:11:16,557","01:11:17,867",you don't wanna sell.
1087,"01:11:18,480","01:11:19,863","I don't sell,"
1088,"01:11:19,864","01:11:22,344","the niggers, I don't wanna sell."
1089,"01:11:25,058","01:11:25,924","Well,"
1090,"01:11:26,419","01:11:28,333",you won't sell your best.
1091,"01:11:28,744","01:11:30,722",You won't even sell your second best.
1092,"01:11:31,330","01:11:33,188",But your third best?
1093,"01:11:33,189","01:11:34,736",You don't want to sell him either.
1094,"01:11:35,167","01:11:38,875",But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...
1095,"01:11:39,950","01:11:41,994",who knows what could happen?
1096,"01:11:44,435","01:11:46,264",And what do you consider ridiculous?
1097,"01:11:47,554","01:11:49,824","For a truly talented specimen,"
1098,"01:11:50,160","01:11:51,447",the right nigger?
1099,"01:11:53,565","01:11:55,049","How much would you say, Django?"
1100,"01:11:58,816","01:12:00,159","$12,000."
1101,"01:12:05,072","01:12:06,169","Well, gentlemen,"
1102,"01:12:07,086","01:12:08,603","you had my curiosity,"
1103,"01:12:09,243","01:12:10,807",but now you have my attention.
1104,"01:12:25,048","01:12:25,834",Willie.
1105,"01:12:27,628","01:12:29,049",Hold up! Hold up.
1106,"01:12:30,681","01:12:31,878","Good morning, gentlemen."

1110,"01:12:37,400","01:12:40,278","Please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria."
1111,"01:12:40,516","01:12:42,059","Oh, thank you very much."

1116,"01:13:06,061","01:13:07,509","above talented,"
1117,"01:13:07,935","01:13:09,742","above loyal that a nigger,"
1118,"01:13:09,743","01:13:11,358",can aspire to.
1119,"01:13:12,107","01:13:13,966","Say, one nigger that just..."
1120,"01:13:13,967","01:13:16,041","pops up in 10,000."
1121,"01:13:16,810","01:13:18,312",The exceptional nigger.

1126,"01:13:33,693","01:13:34,369",Thank you.
1127,"01:13:34,768","01:13:35,729",Quite an honor.
1128,"01:13:35,996","01:13:37,655",The honor is all ours.
1129,"01:13:37,657","01:13:39,747","Thank you, but I do believe,"
1130,"01:13:39,748","01:13:41,184","that given time,"
1131,"01:13:41,563","01:13:44,217",exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...
1132,"01:13:45,476","01:13:47,006",become if not frequent...
1133,"01:13:48,425","01:13:49,714",more frequent.
1134,"01:13:51,804","01:13:53,177","Bright Boy,"
1135,"01:13:54,076","01:13:56,061","you are that one in 10,000."

1139,"01:14:18,990","01:14:21,159",Now I saw the whole thing. No harm done.
1140,"01:14:21,161","01:14:22,265",Are you kidding me?
1141,"01:14:22,267","01:14:24,213",This nigger just... I said no harm done!
1142,"01:14:24,456","01:14:26,111",Now take your hand off your pistol!
1143,"01:14:27,881","01:14:28,711","Butch,"
1144,"01:14:29,539","01:14:30,676",that means you too.
1145,"01:14:32,080","01:14:34,670",Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
1146,"01:14:36,454","01:14:37,079",Hoot!

1152,"01:14:47,031","01:14:49,006","Oh, now you are one lucky nigger."
1153,"01:14:50,155","01:14:51,776","You better listen to your boss, white boy."
1154,"01:14:51,963","01:14:54,241","Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you."
1155,"01:14:54,576","01:14:55,909",You wanna hold my hand?
1156,"01:15:02,499","01:15:03,316","Willie,"
1157,"01:15:04,011","01:15:05,155",take us home.
1158,"01:15:07,421","01:15:08,982",Start moving!
1159,"01:15:15,804","01:15:17,055",Head them out!
1160,"01:16:02,863","01:16:04,464","You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?"
1161,"01:16:04,925","01:16:05,757","No, sir."
1162,"01:16:06,038","01:16:07,540",You want a boot heel in it?
1163,"01:16:08,702","01:16:09,662","No, sir."
1164,"01:16:09,815","01:16:12,197",Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
1165,"01:16:13,121","01:16:16,108","You flash that bad look at me again, I'll give you a reason not to like me."
1166,"01:16:16,476","01:16:17,761","Now move, nigger!"
1167,"01:16:19,826","01:16:21,954",You niggers are gonna understand something about me.
1168,"01:16:22,120","01:16:23,997",I'm worse than any of these white men here.
1169,"01:16:24,484","01:16:27,520","You get the molasses out your ass, you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me."
1170,"01:16:28,131","01:16:29,230","He is,"
1171,"01:16:29,231","01:16:31,070","a rambunctious sort, ain't he?"
1172,"01:16:31,644","01:16:32,543",Indeed.
1173,"01:16:35,092","01:16:38,510",May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear?
1174,"01:16:38,726","01:16:42,334","You know, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland,"
1175,"01:16:42,391","01:16:44,281","so before that moment,"
1176,"01:16:44,282","01:16:45,786",it would be good if I could have
1177,"01:16:45,788","01:16:48,810",a confidential strategy meeting with my...
1178,"01:16:49,206","01:16:50,023",confidant.
1179,"01:16:53,339","01:16:54,985",You mind telling me what the hell you doing?
1180,"01:16:54,987","01:16:57,030",I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.
1181,"01:17:01,172","01:17:02,142",You're sure it's her?
1182,"01:17:02,611","01:17:03,992","He didn't call her by name,"
1183,"01:17:03,994","01:17:05,202","but she's a young lady,"
1184,"01:17:05,203","01:17:07,184",whip marks on her back and speaks German.
1185,"01:17:07,374","01:17:09,605","Now, while it's not wise to assume,"
1186,"01:17:09,607","01:17:11,932","in this instance, I think it's pretty safe."
1187,"01:17:12,176","01:17:13,219","Point being,"
1188,"01:17:13,816","01:17:16,498",don't get so carried away with your retribution.
1189,"01:17:17,080","01:17:18,802",You lose sight of why we're here.
1190,"01:17:19,069","01:17:20,908","You think I lost sight of that? Yes, I do."
1191,"01:17:21,093","01:17:23,047",Stop antagonizing Candie.
1192,"01:17:23,598","01:17:25,822","You're going to blow this whole charade,"
1193,"01:17:25,992","01:17:28,696",or more than likely get us both killed.
1194,"01:17:28,870","01:17:30,907","And I for one, don't intend to die,"
1195,"01:17:30,908","01:17:33,541","in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA."
1196,"01:17:33,904","01:17:35,221",I'm not antagonizing him.
1197,"01:17:35,222","01:17:36,570",I'm intriguing him.
1198,"01:17:36,979","01:17:39,523",You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.
1199,"01:17:40,353","01:17:41,631","I recall the man,"
1200,"01:17:42,951","01:17:45,704",who had me kill another man in front of his son
1201,"01:17:46,138","01:17:47,664",and he didn't bat a eye.
1202,"01:17:49,362","01:17:50,272",You remember that?
1203,"01:17:52,577","01:17:53,911","Yeah, of course I remember."
1204,"01:17:53,962","01:17:55,398",What you said was...
1205,"01:17:55,777","01:17:57,116",that this is my world...
1206,"01:17:58,515","01:17:59,987",and in my world you got to get dirty.
1207,"01:18:01,386","01:18:02,770",So that's what I'm doing.
1208,"01:18:03,098","01:18:04,116",I'm getting dirty.
1209,"01:18:08,144","01:18:11,314","Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but..."
1210,"01:18:12,564","01:18:14,297",that was the general gist.
1211,"01:18:18,295","01:18:20,064",See you at Candyland.
1212,"01:18:27,621","01:18:28,731","Alright, niggers,"
1213,"01:18:29,270","01:18:30,207",back at it.
1214,"01:18:31,633","01:18:33,289","That means you too, Moonlight."
1215,"01:19:20,924","01:19:22,262",I'll be.
1216,"01:19:22,430","01:19:23,562",D'Artagnan!
1217,"01:19:24,572","01:19:26,964","Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?"
1218,"01:19:27,637","01:19:29,665","I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie."
1219,"01:19:30,053","01:19:31,099","Yes, you can."
1220,"01:19:31,537","01:19:33,844","You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight."
1221,"01:19:34,869","01:19:37,403","Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up?"
1222,"01:19:37,614","01:19:38,868",I cannot hear myself think!
1223,"01:19:38,869","01:19:40,177","Quiet down, Marsha!"
1224,"01:19:40,326","01:19:42,639","Marsha, hush up! Marsha!"
1225,"01:19:42,826","01:19:44,256",Hush up! Hey!
1226,"01:19:44,314","01:19:46,815",Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!
1227,"01:19:56,251","01:19:57,352","Come on now, boy..."
1228,"01:19:58,711","01:19:59,790",get on out that tree.
1229,"01:19:59,880","01:20:00,909",Yes sir.
1230,"01:20:24,112","01:20:25,670",How long was he loose?
1231,"01:20:26,406","01:20:27,384",A night.
1232,"01:20:28,032","01:20:28,855",Day.
1233,"01:20:29,927","01:20:31,083",Half the other night.
1234,"01:20:32,579","01:20:33,881",How far he get off the property?
1235,"01:20:34,522","01:20:35,999",About 20 miles off the prop.
1236,"01:20:36,611","01:20:38,738",Pretty far considering that limp he got.
1237,"01:20:41,087","01:20:41,986","Mr. Moguy,"
1238,"01:20:41,987","01:20:44,424",who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?
1239,"01:20:44,591","01:20:45,911",One of this new lot.
1240,"01:20:47,385","01:20:48,712","Well, way he looks now,"
1241,"01:20:48,713","01:20:50,424",a blind Indian would not bet a bead on him.
1242,"01:20:50,526","01:20:53,204","Please Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it in me no more."
1243,"01:20:53,206","01:20:54,414","Now, now, now, now, now. I can't..."
1244,"01:20:54,416","01:20:56,242","Now, no... begging."
1245,"01:20:57,610","01:20:59,388",No playing on my soft heart.
1246,"01:21:03,343","01:21:04,612","You're in trouble, now son."
1247,"01:21:04,613","01:21:05,656",Yes sir.
1248,"01:21:08,232","01:21:09,232",You know.
1249,"01:21:09,564","01:21:11,854",I done paid $500 for you.
1250,"01:21:12,677","01:21:14,826",When I pay $500 thenâ€¦
1251,"01:21:15,253","01:21:17,448",I expect to get five fights out of a nigger
1252,"01:21:17,473","01:21:19,092",before he roll over and play dead.
1253,"01:21:19,093","01:21:19,874",Sir.
1254,"01:21:20,147","01:21:21,455","You got to understand,"
1255,"01:21:21,456","01:21:23,121",that I'm running a business here.
1256,"01:21:24,063","01:21:25,889",You fought three fights.
1257,"01:21:25,890","01:21:27,120",But I won every one.
1258,"01:21:27,122","01:21:28,055","Yes, you did."
1259,"01:21:28,056","01:21:31,471","Yes, you did but that last one, you muddled the line between winning and losing."
1260,"01:21:31,638","01:21:32,507",Yes sir.
1261,"01:21:35,350","01:21:36,845","Still, the fact remains."
1262,"01:21:37,720","01:21:40,822","I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!"
1263,"01:21:41,826","01:21:43,415",So what about my $500?
1264,"01:21:46,058","01:21:47,611",What about my $500?
1265,"01:21:49,358","01:21:50,702",You gonna reimburse me?
1266,"01:21:57,108","01:21:59,054",You even know what reimburse means?
1267,"01:22:07,674","01:22:09,034",I'll reimburse you!
1268,"01:22:13,317","01:22:14,111",You will?
1269,"01:22:15,775","01:22:16,511",Yep.
1270,"01:22:20,106","01:22:21,822","You'll pay $500,"
1271,"01:22:23,046","01:22:26,280",for practically a one-eyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom?
1272,"01:22:26,429","01:22:27,371","No, he won't."
1273,"01:22:29,777","01:22:31,580",He just tired of you toying with him is all.
1274,"01:22:33,028","01:22:34,317","Matter of fact, so am I."
1275,"01:22:35,440","01:22:37,232",But we ain't paying a penny for that pickaninny.
1276,"01:22:37,596","01:22:39,476","Ain't got no use for him. Ain't that right, doc?"
1277,"01:22:41,041","01:22:41,982",You heard him.
1278,"01:22:51,805","01:22:55,428",You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
1279,"01:22:56,498","01:22:59,168",He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.
1280,"01:23:00,019","01:23:01,638","Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?"
1281,"01:23:04,209","01:23:05,198",That right.
1282,"01:23:06,483","01:23:07,487",For that matter...
1283,"01:23:09,297","01:23:10,351",nor have I.
1284,"01:23:16,785","01:23:17,767",Now...
1285,"01:23:19,045","01:23:22,248",seeing as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...
1286,"01:23:24,892","01:23:27,920",you won't mind me handling this nigger any way I see fit?
1287,"01:23:29,323","01:23:30,542",He's your nigger.
1288,"01:23:34,659","01:23:36,049",Mr. Stonesipher?
1289,"01:23:37,815","01:23:40,642",Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
1290,"01:23:41,518","01:23:45,882","Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!"
1291,"01:23:47,774","01:23:49,984","Get him, get him!"
1292,"01:23:51,146","01:23:52,190",Yeah!
1293,"01:24:23,923","01:24:26,044",Your boss looks a little green around the gills
1294,"01:24:26,046","01:24:27,856",for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
1295,"01:24:28,231","01:24:29,051","Nah,"
1296,"01:24:29,896","01:24:32,744",he just ain't used to seeing a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
1297,"01:24:35,613","01:24:36,866",You are used to it?
1298,"01:24:37,405","01:24:39,879",I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is.
1299,"01:24:41,645","01:24:42,353","Now,"
1300,"01:24:42,919","01:24:44,479",Monsieur Candie...
1301,"01:24:45,165","01:24:46,280",whenever you're ready.
1302,"01:24:47,206","01:24:49,770",We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.
1303,"01:24:50,456","01:24:51,753",Let's get to it.
1304,"01:24:53,869","01:24:55,705","Because as of now, if he's an example,"
1305,"01:24:56,396","01:24:57,612",I ain't impressed.
1306,"01:25:00,209","01:25:01,244",Follow me.
1307,"01:26:58,631","01:27:01,210","Line them up to the left here now, boy."
1308,"01:27:02,969","01:27:04,476","Stand up straight, now!"
1309,"01:27:05,513","01:27:06,806",Get up there.
1310,"01:27:06,874","01:27:08,079","Get up there, boy."
1311,"01:27:08,683","01:27:09,441",Come on.
1312,"01:27:09,726","01:27:11,483",Give me a line! Give me a line!
1313,"01:27:11,596","01:27:13,614",Get in line there! Straighten up!
1314,"01:28:13,568","01:28:15,201","Hello! Stephen, my boy!"
1315,"01:28:15,206","01:28:17,548","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, my ass."
1316,"01:28:18,139","01:28:20,838","Who, this nigger up on that nag?"
1317,"01:28:21,352","01:28:22,740","Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?"
1318,"01:28:23,250","01:28:24,808",What's a matter? Why you so ornery?
1319,"01:28:24,809","01:28:26,692","You miss me? Oh, yes sir."
1320,"01:28:27,319","01:28:28,574","I miss you,"
1321,"01:28:28,681","01:28:30,762",like a hog miss slop!
1322,"01:28:30,851","01:28:34,179",Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
1323,"01:28:34,903","01:28:38,938",I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.
1324,"01:28:41,384","01:28:42,884","Now I ask you,"
1325,"01:28:43,333","01:28:45,993",who this nigger on that nag?
1326,"01:28:45,995","01:28:46,982","Hey, Snowball?"
1327,"01:28:48,805","01:28:50,784","Wanna know my name or the name of my horse,"
1328,"01:28:51,233","01:28:52,203",you ask me.
1329,"01:28:52,622","01:28:55,446","Just who the hell you calling Snowball, horse boy?"
1330,"01:28:55,547","01:28:56,893",I'll snatch your black ass
1331,"01:28:56,894","01:28:58,654",off that nag there and in the mud so fast...
1332,"01:28:58,656","01:29:00,638","make your head spin. Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen."
1333,"01:29:01,004","01:29:02,317",Let's keep it funny.
1334,"01:29:03,204","01:29:04,658",Django here's a free man.
1335,"01:29:05,703","01:29:07,699",This nigger here? That nigger there.
1336,"01:29:08,011","01:29:10,263",Let me at least introduce the two of you.
1337,"01:29:10,430","01:29:11,450","Django,"
1338,"01:29:11,590","01:29:14,334","this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen."
1339,"01:29:14,541","01:29:16,087","Stephen, this here's Django."
1340,"01:29:16,387","01:29:17,645",You two oughta hate each other.
1341,"01:29:17,812","01:29:18,729","Calvin,"
1342,"01:29:18,829","01:29:22,082",just who the hell is this nigger you feels the need to entertain?
1343,"01:29:22,148","01:29:26,068","Django and his friend in gray here, Dr. Schultz, are customers."
1344,"01:29:26,366","01:29:27,743","And they are our guests, Stephen."
1345,"01:29:27,778","01:29:31,538","And you, you old decrepit bastard, oughta show them every hospitality."
1346,"01:29:31,540","01:29:34,026",You understand that? Yes sir. Him I understand.
1347,"01:29:34,028","01:29:35,862",But I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger.
1348,"01:29:35,863","01:29:38,291",You don't have to know why. Do you understand?
1349,"01:29:39,573","01:29:41,074",Yes sir. I understand.
1350,"01:29:41,077","01:29:42,387","Well, good."
1351,"01:29:42,865","01:29:43,776",They're spending the night.
1352,"01:29:43,778","01:29:45,593",Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
1353,"01:29:46,953","01:29:48,621",He gonna stay in The Big House?
1354,"01:29:48,779","01:29:50,430","Stephen, he's a slaver."
1355,"01:29:50,596","01:29:52,570",It's different. In The Big House?
1356,"01:29:52,695","01:29:53,977","Well, you got a problem with that?"
1357,"01:29:53,992","01:29:56,449","Oh, no. I ain't got no problem with it,"
1358,"01:29:56,574","01:29:58,801","if you ain't got no problem with burning the bed, the sheets,"
1359,"01:29:58,919","01:30:00,796","the pillowcases, everything else"
1360,"01:30:00,797","01:30:02,299",when this black-ass motherfucker's gone! That is my problem!
1361,"01:30:02,300","01:30:03,374",They are mine to burn!
1362,"01:30:03,566","01:30:05,776",Now your problem right now is making a good impression!
1363,"01:30:06,115","01:30:08,145",And I want you to start solving that problem right now
1364,"01:30:08,193","01:30:09,819",and get them goddamn rooms ready!
1365,"01:30:11,933","01:30:13,148","Yes sir, Monsieur Candie."
1366,"01:30:15,036","01:30:16,083","Go on, now."
1367,"01:30:17,121","01:30:19,540",Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House.
1368,"01:30:19,707","01:30:21,975",Your daddy rolling over in his goddamned grave.
1369,"01:30:21,977","01:30:24,821","Man, the lip on him. He's getting worse and worse."
1370,"01:30:24,921","01:30:25,835","Now,"
1371,"01:30:26,379","01:30:30,772",where is my beautiful sister?
1372,"01:30:31,289","01:30:32,566",There she is!
1373,"01:30:34,701","01:30:35,849","Dr. Schultz,"
1374,"01:30:36,230","01:30:39,393",this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister.
1375,"01:30:39,560","01:30:40,479","Darling,"
1376,"01:30:41,122","01:30:43,564",you are a tonic for tired eyes.
1377,"01:30:44,816","01:30:46,299","May I present to you,"
1378,"01:30:46,424","01:30:48,445",Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
1379,"01:30:48,593","01:30:52,052","Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly. Y'all get your ass over by that pen."
1380,"01:30:52,054","01:30:54,362","Come on, Charly. Come on, now! Let's go."
1381,"01:30:54,364","01:30:55,407",You know where it is.
1382,"01:30:55,409","01:30:56,924",Like you on a rope!
1383,"01:30:58,371","01:31:00,877","Niggers don't walk around here, niggers run!"
1384,"01:31:02,036","01:31:03,637",Monsieur Candie?
1385,"01:31:05,002","01:31:05,929",Yeah.
1386,"01:31:06,178","01:31:08,678",About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about?
1387,"01:31:09,059","01:31:10,018",Nigger gal?
1388,"01:31:10,091","01:31:13,353","Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German."
1389,"01:31:14,255","01:31:15,834","Yes! Hilda, what about her?"
1390,"01:31:16,360","01:31:18,816","Do you think before the demonstration,"
1391,"01:31:18,817","01:31:20,450",you could send her around to my room?
1392,"01:31:20,889","01:31:22,949","You little dickens, you."
1393,"01:31:23,660","01:31:24,930",I don't see why not.
1394,"01:31:24,932","01:31:25,658","Stephen,"
1395,"01:31:25,659","01:31:28,392","when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hilda,"
1396,"01:31:28,394","01:31:30,507","get her cleaned up and smelling real nice,"
1397,"01:31:30,531","01:31:31,654",and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here.
1398,"01:31:31,734","01:31:33,822","Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,"
1399,"01:31:33,830","01:31:36,325",there is a something I ain't told you about yet.
1400,"01:31:36,685","01:31:37,410",What?
1401,"01:31:37,865","01:31:40,068",Hilda in the Hot Box.
1402,"01:31:42,120","01:31:43,170",What's she doing there?
1403,"01:31:43,347","01:31:45,847",What you think she doing there in the Hot Box?
1404,"01:31:45,912","01:31:46,998",She being punished.
1405,"01:31:47,587","01:31:49,744",What she do? She run off again.
1406,"01:31:50,432","01:31:53,269","Jesus Christ Stephen, how many people ran away while I was gone?"
1407,"01:31:53,271","01:31:53,811",Two.
1408,"01:31:54,776","01:31:55,682",When did she go?
1409,"01:31:55,760","01:31:58,094",Last night. They brung her back this morning.
1410,"01:31:58,936","01:32:01,269",How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
1411,"01:32:02,038","01:32:05,456","Lucky for her, they was out chasing D'Artagnan's ass."
1412,"01:32:05,785","01:32:07,497","Bill and Cody went looking for her,"
1413,"01:32:07,499","01:32:09,031","found her, brung her back."
1414,"01:32:10,217","01:32:11,526","Now, she a little beat-up."
1415,"01:32:11,527","01:32:13,227",But she done that to her own damn self
1416,"01:32:13,229","01:32:14,475",running through them damn bushes and shit.
1417,"01:32:14,570","01:32:16,026",How long she been in the box?
1418,"01:32:16,282","01:32:19,338",How long you think she been in there? All damn day.
1419,"01:32:19,440","01:32:22,029",And the little bitch got ten more days to be in there.
1420,"01:32:22,791","01:32:24,015","Still, take her out."
1421,"01:32:24,179","01:32:25,453",Take her out? Why?
1422,"01:32:25,455","01:32:27,394","Because I said so, that's why."
1423,"01:32:27,395","01:32:29,376",Dr. Schultz is my guest.
1424,"01:32:29,526","01:32:30,736",Hilda is my nigger.
1425,"01:32:30,738","01:32:32,458","Southern hospitality dictates,"
1426,"01:32:32,459","01:32:34,032",I make her available to him.
1427,"01:32:34,034","01:32:35,889","But, Monsieur Candie, she run off."
1428,"01:32:35,890","01:32:37,253","Jesus Christ, Stephen."
1429,"01:32:37,255","01:32:39,856",What is the point of having a nigger that speaks German
1430,"01:32:40,013","01:32:42,352",if you can't wheel them out when you have a German guest?
1431,"01:32:42,577","01:32:46,604","Now, I realize it is inconvenient, but still, you take her ass out."
1432,"01:32:46,771","01:32:47,647",Yes sir.
1433,"01:32:49,232","01:32:50,303",Lara Lee!
1434,"01:32:50,304","01:32:51,963",Will you and Cora be responsible
1435,"01:32:52,022","01:32:55,551",for getting Hilda cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
1436,"01:32:55,646","01:32:57,023","Of course, darling."
1437,"01:32:57,073","01:32:59,093","Now gentlemen, I do apologize,"
1438,"01:32:59,094","01:33:01,953",but I am weary from our travels beyond words.
1439,"01:33:02,345","01:33:04,722",It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
1440,"01:33:09,957","01:33:12,588",Y'all done heard the man! Get her ass up outta there!
1441,"01:33:13,144","01:33:14,027",Cora!
1442,"01:33:14,028","01:33:15,001",Come here!
1443,"01:33:15,466","01:33:17,215","Get over there and get her cleaned up,"
1444,"01:33:17,217","01:33:18,700",bring her back over here to Dr...
1445,"01:33:18,934","01:33:21,042",What he say your name is? Shoots? Schultz.
1446,"01:33:21,386","01:33:22,399",Schultz.
1447,"01:33:22,400","01:33:24,003","Get her back over here. Hurry up, girl."
1448,"01:33:24,005","01:33:24,731",Yes sir.
1449,"01:34:11,061","01:34:12,057","Come on, girl."
1450,"01:34:12,724","01:34:13,524",Stand up.
1451,"01:34:43,694","01:34:46,935",Is you coming with me or is you gonna sleep in that little box over yonder?
1452,"01:36:22,278","01:36:23,737","Hello, ladies."
1453,"01:36:23,904","01:36:24,969",Dr. Schultz.
1454,"01:36:25,485","01:36:27,344",May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
1455,"01:36:31,454","01:36:33,126","Hilda, this is Dr. Schultz."
1456,"01:36:35,522","01:36:37,501","It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda."
1457,"01:36:38,906","01:36:40,880",I've heard a lot of good things about you.
1458,"01:36:41,046","01:36:44,008","Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know."
1459,"01:36:47,094","01:36:49,096","As I look at you now, Broomhilda,"
1460,"01:36:49,907","01:36:53,979",I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified.
1461,"01:36:57,789","01:36:59,587",The doctor here speaks German.
1462,"01:37:02,049","01:37:04,009",And I've been informed you do as well?
1463,"01:37:05,404","01:37:07,573","Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German."
1464,"01:37:16,468","01:37:17,842",Astonishing.
1465,"01:37:25,054","01:37:26,639",And I shall bring you... Much obliged.
1466,"01:37:36,602","01:37:37,431","<font color=""#ffff00"">Yes.</font>"
1467,"01:37:58,586","01:38:00,032","<font color=""#ffff00""><i>Don't be afraid.</i></font>"
1468,"01:38:01,180","01:38:02,355",Don't be afraid.
1469,"01:38:42,103","01:38:42,962",Pardon.
1470,"01:38:50,759","01:38:51,719","<font color=""#ffff00"">Thank you.</font>"
1471,"01:40:20,534","01:40:22,222","<font color=""#ffff00"">I promise.</font>"
1472,"01:40:37,772","01:40:39,089","Hey, Little Trouble Maker."
1473,"01:40:48,274","01:40:50,732","You silver-tongued devil, you."
1474,"01:40:52,548","01:40:54,297","Hurry up, girl. These ready, Miss Cora."
1475,"01:40:54,388","01:40:55,835","No, no, no, they drinking tonight."
1476,"01:40:55,851","01:40:58,576","Go downstairs, get the big jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?"
1477,"01:40:58,758","01:41:00,349",Get your big pretty ass out the way.
1478,"01:41:00,380","01:41:01,746",You know you like it.
1479,"01:41:02,280","01:41:04,056",That's because you knows what I like.
1480,"01:41:04,127","01:41:06,794","Come on with these biscuits, girl."
1481,"01:41:07,011","01:41:08,121","Look, Monsieur Candie,"
1482,"01:41:08,603","01:41:11,916","they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it."
1483,"01:41:12,609","01:41:15,518",But the best three by far were...
1484,"01:41:15,956","01:41:16,898",Samson.
1485,"01:41:18,365","01:41:19,966",What's that other one's name? Goldie.
1486,"01:41:20,117","01:41:21,043",Goldie.
1487,"01:41:21,546","01:41:23,097",And Eskimo Joe.
1488,"01:41:23,789","01:41:25,991","By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?"
1489,"01:41:26,532","01:41:29,460",You never know how these nigger nicknames get started.
1490,"01:41:29,626","01:41:32,212","His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold."
1491,"01:41:32,214","01:41:33,357",Who knows?
1492,"01:41:36,354","01:41:37,540","Well, regardless,"
1493,"01:41:37,928","01:41:39,316",Samson's your best.
1494,"01:41:39,898","01:41:41,066",We all know that.
1495,"01:41:41,559","01:41:42,838","You will never sell him,"
1496,"01:41:42,965","01:41:43,973",and I can see why.
1497,"01:41:44,231","01:41:45,703",He's a champion.
1498,"01:41:47,012","01:41:48,707",All three are champions.
1499,"01:41:49,688","01:41:50,943",Samson's the champion.
1500,"01:41:52,143","01:41:53,501",Them other two pretty good.
1501,"01:41:55,197","01:41:56,628","Calvin, now what's this nigger you let..."
1502,"01:41:56,695","01:41:58,033",It's alright. It's alright.
1503,"01:41:58,097","01:41:59,758","You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,"
1504,"01:42:00,240","01:42:03,753","while admittedly a neophyte, in the nigger fight game,"
1505,"01:42:03,786","01:42:08,247",I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus.
1506,"01:42:08,248","01:42:09,333",Is that right?
1507,"01:42:09,644","01:42:10,663","Hence,"
1508,"01:42:10,888","01:42:13,587",I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
1509,"01:42:15,046","01:42:17,150",I need something more than just a big nigger.
1510,"01:42:19,258","01:42:21,478","Yeah, he needs to have panache."
1511,"01:42:21,602","01:42:23,626",Need to have what? What? Panache.
1512,"01:42:25,050","01:42:27,728","A sense of Showmanship. Showmanship, yes."
1513,"01:42:27,730","01:42:29,409",I want to be able to bill him
1514,"01:42:29,612","01:42:31,397",as The Black Hercules.
1515,"01:42:32,949","01:42:34,595","The Black Hercules, isn't that clever?"
1516,"01:42:34,673","01:42:35,674",More like Nigger-les.
1517,"01:42:38,030","01:42:39,906","I said and I told,"
1518,"01:42:40,620","01:42:42,279","I would pay top dollar,"
1519,"01:42:42,529","01:42:43,251",for...
1520,"01:42:43,989","01:42:45,863",the right nigger.
1521,"01:42:46,794","01:42:50,063","Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se."
1522,"01:42:51,218","01:42:53,616",But is he right as rain?
1523,"01:42:55,087","01:42:56,289","Oh, Dr. Schultz,"
1524,"01:42:56,970","01:42:58,201","I will have you know,"
1525,"01:42:58,339","01:42:59,555","there is no one,"
1526,"01:42:59,556","01:43:00,622",in the nigger fight game
1527,"01:43:00,694","01:43:02,880",that appreciates the value of showmanship
1528,"01:43:02,882","01:43:04,946",more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here.
1529,"01:43:04,948","01:43:05,804",Nobody.
1530,"01:43:05,917","01:43:09,184",But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.
1531,"01:43:09,351","01:43:11,923",And that is a nigger that can win fights.
1532,"01:43:12,896","01:43:17,109","Now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern."
1533,"01:43:17,276","01:43:19,356","Now, after you have that, and you know you have that,"
1534,"01:43:19,486","01:43:20,956","then you can start,"
1535,"01:43:20,957","01:43:22,694",to implement a grand design.
1536,"01:43:23,513","01:43:24,514","In other words,"
1537,"01:43:24,617","01:43:26,281",first thing is first.
1538,"01:43:26,326","01:43:27,786",First thing's first.
1539,"01:43:36,896","01:43:38,747",I see you two getting on.
1540,"01:43:39,742","01:43:40,791",Famously.
1541,"01:43:41,633","01:43:43,080","Oh, Monsieur Candie,"
1542,"01:43:43,081","01:43:44,654",you can't imagine what it's like
1543,"01:43:44,656","01:43:46,846","not to hear your native tongue,"
1544,"01:43:46,847","01:43:48,051",in four years.
1545,"01:43:48,083","01:43:50,353","Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston."
1546,"01:43:52,516","01:43:53,926",Two weeks in Boston!
1547,"01:43:54,383","01:43:56,146","Monsieur Candie, you a mess!"
1548,"01:43:57,302","01:43:58,997",Two weeks in Boston!
1549,"01:43:59,276","01:44:02,525",I can't express the joy I felt
1550,"01:44:02,526","01:44:04,489",conversing in my mother tongue.
1551,"01:44:04,656","01:44:08,988",And Hilda is a charming conversation companion.
1552,"01:44:09,051","01:44:11,198","Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz."
1553,"01:44:11,518","01:44:13,707",You might-a caught yourself a little dose of nigger love.
1554,"01:44:14,329","01:44:16,340","Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy."
1555,"01:44:16,825","01:44:18,578",It's like a pool of black tar.
1556,"01:44:18,624","01:44:20,251","Once it catches your ass, you're caught."
1557,"01:44:20,388","01:44:21,947","Yes sir, you stuck."
1558,"01:44:23,292","01:44:24,573","I don't know, doctor."
1559,"01:44:25,090","01:44:27,342","You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want,"
1560,"01:44:27,408","01:44:28,267",but...
1561,"01:44:28,268","01:44:31,740",it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.
1562,"01:44:34,552","01:44:35,312","Well,"
1563,"01:44:35,699","01:44:36,987",naturally.
1564,"01:44:37,062","01:44:38,736","It is the soaring,"
1565,"01:44:38,737","01:44:40,690","eagle that attracts her attention,"
1566,"01:44:40,692","01:44:42,312",not the plucked chicken.
1567,"01:44:43,654","01:44:46,661","Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself."
1568,"01:44:46,663","01:44:48,575",You are quite the dapper European gentleman.
1569,"01:44:48,590","01:44:49,608","You got to clean these dishes,"
1570,"01:44:49,618","01:44:51,900","you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me?"
1571,"01:44:51,981","01:44:54,006","You know that nigger, don't you?"
1572,"01:44:55,204","01:44:56,325",Who? Who?
1573,"01:44:56,500","01:44:59,031","Don't who me, bitch. You know who I'm talking about."
1574,"01:45:01,463","01:45:02,594",At the table?
1575,"01:45:03,486","01:45:04,633",I don't know him.
1576,"01:45:05,052","01:45:06,430",You don't know him.
1577,"01:45:06,838","01:45:07,649",No.
1578,"01:45:08,011","01:45:09,038","No, what?"
1579,"01:45:09,749","01:45:10,665","No, sir."
1580,"01:45:15,780","01:45:17,611","You would not lie to me now, would you?"
1581,"01:45:22,384","01:45:23,263",Ok.
1582,"01:45:24,829","01:45:27,729",Yeah. If you say so.
1583,"01:45:34,204","01:45:35,921","Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,"
1584,"01:45:36,492","01:45:37,518",no doubt about it.
1585,"01:45:39,275","01:45:40,375","But if it was my money,"
1586,"01:45:42,113","01:45:44,250","I would not pay no $12,000 for him."
1587,"01:45:44,504","01:45:46,259",What would your price be?
1588,"01:45:46,842","01:45:48,802","Well, if I was inclined to be generous,"
1589,"01:45:48,969","01:45:50,371","and I don't know why,"
1590,"01:45:50,497","01:45:52,276",I would be inclined to be generous...
1591,"01:45:53,390","01:45:54,641","9,000."
1592,"01:45:56,135","01:45:56,807",Maybe.
1593,"01:45:57,894","01:45:58,851","Dr. Schultz,"
1594,"01:45:59,960","01:46:01,921",let me reclarify how this whole
1595,"01:46:01,922","01:46:03,692",negotiation came about.
1596,"01:46:04,204","01:46:06,437","You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger."
1597,"01:46:06,507","01:46:07,286",Sure wasn't.
1598,"01:46:07,289","01:46:09,309",It was you who approached me to buy one.
1599,"01:46:09,339","01:46:10,257",Sure was.
1600,"01:46:10,429","01:46:14,358","Now, that $9,000 figure Bright Boy's been bandying about, that ain't too far off from right."
1601,"01:46:14,365","01:46:16,283","And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,"
1602,"01:46:16,285","01:46:18,623",I could do so any day of the week. Any day.
1603,"01:46:19,162","01:46:21,116","But, like you said in Greenville, doctor..."
1604,"01:46:21,740","01:46:23,100",I don't want to sell him.
1605,"01:46:23,920","01:46:24,993",It was only your...
1606,"01:46:25,601","01:46:28,409","ridiculous offer of $12,000"
1607,"01:46:28,411","01:46:30,330",that made me even consider it.
1608,"01:46:39,426","01:46:43,190","You know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion."
1609,"01:46:47,420","01:46:49,980","Why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal."
1610,"01:46:49,982","01:46:52,259","Eskimo Joe, $12,000."
1611,"01:46:52,466","01:46:53,420","Hooray, doctor."
1612,"01:46:53,451","01:46:55,492",Hooray. And a wise decision that is.
1613,"01:46:55,743","01:46:58,956","However, that is a tremendous amount of money."
1614,"01:46:59,391","01:47:02,454","And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer."
1615,"01:47:02,542","01:47:04,336",Persnickety man named Tuttle.
1616,"01:47:04,727","01:47:07,919",And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract
1617,"01:47:08,052","01:47:11,464",before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.
1618,"01:47:12,135","01:47:14,124","Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined,"
1619,"01:47:14,126","01:47:16,516",by a physician of my choosing. Naturally.
1620,"01:47:17,110","01:47:21,002","So, say I return in about..."
1621,"01:47:23,848","01:47:25,941",five days time. Five days?
1622,"01:47:26,108","01:47:27,475",With my Mr. Tuttle.
1623,"01:47:27,695","01:47:29,951","And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy,"
1624,"01:47:29,953","01:47:32,199",can hash out the finer details between themselves.
1625,"01:47:33,732","01:47:35,365","I say splendid, doctor."
1626,"01:47:35,639","01:47:36,698",Splendid.
1627,"01:47:37,327","01:47:38,305",Gentlemen...
1628,"01:47:39,707","01:47:41,267",may I propose a toast.
1629,"01:47:43,974","01:47:45,627",To Eskimo Joe.
1630,"01:47:45,628","01:47:47,571",Or shall we call him.
1631,"01:47:47,945","01:47:49,216",The Black Hercules?
1632,"01:47:50,144","01:47:51,591",To The Black Hercules.
1633,"01:47:51,758","01:47:53,135",The Black Hercules.
1634,"01:47:53,301","01:47:54,719",To The Black Hercules.
1635,"01:47:54,886","01:47:56,319","You was right, doctor."
1636,"01:47:56,320","01:47:57,777",That name do have pan-ass.
1637,"01:48:00,775","01:48:01,489","Hilda,"
1638,"01:48:02,406","01:48:03,543",top my drink off.
1639,"01:48:06,815","01:48:07,780","So Hilda,"
1640,"01:48:08,498","01:48:10,925",how you like serving at the big table in The Big House?
1641,"01:48:12,135","01:48:14,562","When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers."
1642,"01:48:15,526","01:48:17,403","I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie."
1643,"01:48:18,536","01:48:22,476",It's a lot better than sizzling in that Hot Box or dragging your ass through a bramble bush.
1644,"01:48:22,908","01:48:26,220","But maybe it's not quite as much fun as getting to pleasure all them Mandingos,"
1645,"01:48:26,222","01:48:27,173","Sugar bear? Oh, Lord."
1646,"01:48:27,174","01:48:27,940",She like them niggers.
1647,"01:48:27,958","01:48:28,936",Sure do. Like Samson?
1648,"01:48:28,945","01:48:29,984","No, sir."
1649,"01:48:30,714","01:48:32,048","You know, Monsieur Candie,"
1650,"01:48:32,360","01:48:36,162","the doctor here might be interested in seeing Hilda's peeled back,"
1651,"01:48:36,208","01:48:39,183",seeing as how they don't have many niggers where he come from.
1652,"01:48:39,472","01:48:40,603","Dr. Schultz,"
1653,"01:48:40,738","01:48:42,365","when you was alone with Hilda, here,"
1654,"01:48:42,366","01:48:44,114",did you just speak German or...
1655,"01:48:44,115","01:48:45,411",did you get to take her clothes off?
1656,"01:48:45,478","01:48:46,830","No, we just talked and..."
1657,"01:48:47,053","01:48:49,078","Oh, so you haven't seen her back?"
1658,"01:48:49,587","01:48:51,684","I haven't... No, no, no, no."
1659,"01:48:51,692","01:48:53,599","Stephen's right, you might find this interesting."
1660,"01:48:53,841","01:48:56,908","Hilda, go on, take off your dress. Show Dr. Schultz your back here."
1661,"01:48:57,056","01:48:58,347",Go on. Calvin.
1662,"01:48:59,177","01:49:01,369",I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.
1663,"01:49:01,536","01:49:04,637","But, Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf."
1664,"01:49:04,806","01:49:06,208",They don't got niggers there.
1665,"01:49:06,209","01:49:07,876",He is a man of medicine.
1666,"01:49:07,946","01:49:10,735","I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain."
1667,"01:49:10,844","01:49:14,291","These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it."
1668,"01:49:14,377","01:49:16,850",Hilda's got something like four lashes on her back.
1669,"01:49:16,852","01:49:19,199","Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind."
1670,"01:49:19,201","01:49:20,331","Sure would. Look at that, doctor."
1671,"01:49:20,333","01:49:22,042",It's like a painting. Look at that. Calvin!
1672,"01:49:23,073","01:49:25,946",We are eating. Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back.
1673,"01:49:28,407","01:49:30,190","Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine."
1674,"01:49:30,743","01:49:32,078","After dinner, then, Stephen."
1675,"01:49:32,227","01:49:33,104",After dinner.
1676,"01:49:34,463","01:49:35,744","During the brandies, gentlemen?"
1677,"01:49:42,410","01:49:43,954","Cora, come get this girl!"
1678,"01:49:47,415","01:49:48,446",She a mess.
1679,"01:49:48,879","01:49:49,802","Yes, ma'am."
1680,"01:49:50,794","01:49:52,350",Why are you all undone?
1681,"01:49:52,351","01:49:53,345",I just got you done up.
1682,"01:49:53,347","01:49:54,552",Come on in here.
1683,"01:50:01,263","01:50:03,442","Baby, you on Stephen bad side,"
1684,"01:50:03,443","01:50:05,280",and you need to be on his blind side.
1685,"01:50:05,396","01:50:07,231",You say you ain't know him.
1686,"01:50:09,562","01:50:10,618","I said,"
1687,"01:50:11,526","01:50:14,682",you said you ain't know him.
1688,"01:50:16,319","01:50:17,300",I don't.
1689,"01:50:18,453","01:50:19,510","Yes, you do."
1690,"01:50:22,186","01:50:23,306",Mr. Stephen...
1691,"01:50:24,721","01:50:25,495",I don't.
1692,"01:50:26,060","01:50:27,833",Why is you lying to me?
1693,"01:50:30,542","01:50:31,530",I ain't.
1694,"01:50:32,562","01:50:33,794",Then why is you crying?
1695,"01:50:35,202","01:50:36,615",You scaring me.
1696,"01:50:37,048","01:50:38,439",Why is I'm scaring you?
1697,"01:50:39,542","01:50:40,760",Because you scary.
1698,"01:50:42,637","01:50:45,724",To speak German this afternoon with Hilda
1699,"01:50:45,890","01:50:48,453",was positively soul-enriching.
1700,"01:50:49,185","01:50:51,238","Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that."
1701,"01:50:52,450","01:50:54,602",You stay right here.
1702,"01:51:00,405","01:51:02,418","You indicated earlier,"
1703,"01:51:02,928","01:51:05,127",you'd be willing to part with Hilda.
1704,"01:51:05,404","01:51:07,757","Why, yes. Yessiree bob, I did."
1705,"01:51:10,079","01:51:11,342","In that case,"
1706,"01:51:11,944","01:51:13,369",allow me...
1707,"01:51:13,973","01:51:15,785",to propose another proposition.
1708,"01:51:16,320","01:51:17,220",I'm all ears.
1709,"01:51:17,455","01:51:19,165","Hurry up, goddamn it!"
1710,"01:51:20,110","01:51:21,490",Monsieur Candie... Stephen!
1711,"01:51:22,716","01:51:24,633",You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
1712,"01:51:26,139","01:51:28,379","I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz."
1713,"01:51:28,736","01:51:31,144",My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
1714,"01:51:31,311","01:51:32,437",Excuse him.
1715,"01:51:32,604","01:51:35,425","Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen?"
1716,"01:51:36,734","01:51:38,443",You mean get up out of my chair?
1717,"01:51:38,819","01:51:40,691",If'n you could manage it.
1718,"01:51:40,974","01:51:41,703",Why?
1719,"01:51:42,344","01:51:44,055",It's about dessert.
1720,"01:51:44,056","01:51:45,367",What about dessert?
1721,"01:51:46,184","01:51:48,599",I'd rather discuss that in private.
1722,"01:51:48,912","01:51:50,711",We're having white cake!
1723,"01:51:51,234","01:51:53,446",What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?
1724,"01:51:53,893","01:51:57,595","You right, Monsieur Candie. You right. I'll handle it myself."
1725,"01:51:57,962","01:51:59,756",Meet me in the library.
1726,"01:51:59,923","01:52:03,278",I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers.
1727,"01:52:03,286","01:52:05,166","Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me."
1728,"01:52:05,385","01:52:07,311","Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen, I..."
1729,"01:52:08,311","01:52:09,988",I will be along momentarily.
1730,"01:52:10,392","01:52:11,296",Yes sir.
1731,"01:52:12,586","01:52:13,403","Well,"
1732,"01:52:14,439","01:52:15,427","gentlemen,"
1733,"01:52:15,835","01:52:18,402","as you can see talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,"
1734,"01:52:18,436","01:52:19,506","from time to time,"
1735,"01:52:20,163","01:52:22,177",adult supervision is required.
1736,"01:52:24,864","01:52:26,431",If you'll excuse me a moment.
1737,"01:52:32,831","01:52:34,624",You may clear the dinner service.
1738,"01:52:36,165","01:52:37,666",You heard him. Go on! Get.
1739,"01:52:39,040","01:52:39,993","Hurry up, girl."
1740,"01:52:40,031","01:52:41,047","So, Dr. Schultz,"
1741,"01:52:42,031","01:52:44,574",why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus.
1742,"01:52:45,564","01:52:47,008",The circus?
1743,"01:52:54,469","01:52:55,772",What is the matter?
1744,"01:53:01,628","01:53:06,129",Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
1745,"01:53:06,886","01:53:08,205",They wants that girl.
1746,"01:53:10,530","01:53:11,358","Stephen,"
1747,"01:53:11,529","01:53:12,841",what the hell are you talking about?
1748,"01:53:13,412","01:53:15,200",They playing your ass for a fool
1749,"01:53:15,201","01:53:16,582",is what I'm talking about.
1750,"01:53:16,970","01:53:18,137","They ain't here,"
1751,"01:53:18,813","01:53:20,295",for no musclebound Jimmie.
1752,"01:53:21,123","01:53:22,415",They here for that girl.
1753,"01:53:22,797","01:53:24,354",Wh... What girl?
1754,"01:53:24,356","01:53:25,425",Wha... Hilda?
1755,"01:53:25,592","01:53:26,685","Yeah, Hilda."
1756,"01:53:26,849","01:53:27,784","Her and Django,"
1757,"01:53:28,142","01:53:29,404",them niggers know each other.
1758,"01:53:31,157","01:53:33,075",He just bought Eskimo Joe.
1759,"01:53:33,077","01:53:34,231",Did he give you any money?
1760,"01:53:34,232","01:53:35,302",No! Not yet. But...
1761,"01:53:35,304","01:53:36,823",Then he ain't bought diddly.
1762,"01:53:36,824","01:53:37,765","Not yet, no how."
1763,"01:53:38,134","01:53:40,106",But he's just about to buy...
1764,"01:53:40,492","01:53:43,094",who he come here to buy when I interrupted him.
1765,"01:53:43,987","01:53:45,045","Thank you, Stephen."
1766,"01:53:45,436","01:53:46,668","You're welcome, Calvin."
1767,"01:53:52,076","01:53:54,078",Where you getting all this?
1768,"01:53:55,438","01:53:58,772","Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger with a chewed up back,"
1769,"01:53:58,773","01:54:00,199",ain't worth $300?
1770,"01:54:00,355","01:54:03,757",They doing it because that nigger Django's in love with Hilda.
1771,"01:54:04,450","01:54:05,747",She probably his wife.
1772,"01:54:06,454","01:54:10,389","Now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with,"
1773,"01:54:10,390","01:54:12,177",I'm sure I don't know.
1774,"01:54:14,933","01:54:16,603",If she's who they want...
1775,"01:54:17,477","01:54:18,843",why this whole...
1776,"01:54:19,128","01:54:21,773","snake oil pitch about Mandingos, then?"
1777,"01:54:22,065","01:54:25,094",You would not pay no never mind to no $300.
1778,"01:54:25,893","01:54:27,573","But that 12,000?"
1779,"01:54:28,709","01:54:30,648","That made you real friendly, now, didn't it?"
1780,"01:54:33,785","01:54:35,173","Yes, it did."
1781,"01:54:38,954","01:54:40,018",His wife?
1782,"01:54:44,703","01:54:46,205","If it had been a snake,"
1783,"01:54:46,987","01:54:48,231",it would have bit me.
1784,"01:54:51,653","01:54:53,325",Those lying...
1785,"01:54:54,364","01:54:56,411",goddamn time...
1786,"01:54:56,682","01:54:59,916",wasting sons of bitches.
1787,"01:55:02,355","01:55:03,523",Sons of bitches!
1788,"01:55:04,148","01:55:05,126","Out of New Orleans,"
1789,"01:55:05,127","01:55:08,723",so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types.
1790,"01:55:10,309","01:55:11,449","Oh, there you are."
1791,"01:55:12,049","01:55:14,843",I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together.
1792,"01:55:16,529","01:55:18,479","That'd be a hell of a note, would not it?"
1793,"01:55:19,357","01:55:20,115","Lara Lee,"
1794,"01:55:20,491","01:55:22,146",I was just looking out the big window.
1795,"01:55:22,165","01:55:24,152",Billy Crash is out there dealing with some...
1796,"01:55:24,348","01:55:25,341",shady slaver
1797,"01:55:25,343","01:55:26,772",trying to sell a passel of ponies.
1798,"01:55:26,774","01:55:29,672","Would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball?"
1799,"01:55:30,672","01:55:31,942","Of course, brother."
1800,"01:55:31,943","01:55:32,924","Thank you, darling."
1801,"01:55:45,875","01:55:47,023",Yeah.
1802,"01:55:47,173","01:55:48,877",Business never sleeps.
1803,"01:55:51,779","01:55:52,734","Apropos,"
1804,"01:55:53,380","01:55:54,878","before your exit,"
1805,"01:55:55,097","01:55:59,189",we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.
1806,"01:55:59,202","01:56:00,085",Ah yes.
1807,"01:56:00,511","01:56:01,766","Yes, we were, doctor."
1808,"01:56:02,224","01:56:04,351",And we will again. In a moment.
1809,"01:56:20,725","01:56:22,418",Who's your little friend?
1810,"01:56:27,732","01:56:28,987",This is Ben.
1811,"01:56:30,734","01:56:32,262",He's a old Joe that...
1812,"01:56:32,743","01:56:34,894",lived around here for a long time.
1813,"01:56:35,841","01:56:37,634",And I do mean a long damn time.
1814,"01:56:39,526","01:56:40,659","Old Ben here,"
1815,"01:56:41,358","01:56:42,910",took care of my daddy...
1816,"01:56:43,873","01:56:45,504",and my daddy's daddy.
1817,"01:56:46,286","01:56:48,455",Till he up and keeled over one day.
1818,"01:56:51,506","01:56:53,174",Old Ben took care of me.
1819,"01:56:55,760","01:56:57,366",Growing up the son of a...
1820,"01:56:57,601","01:57:00,006",a huge plantation owner in Mississippi
1821,"01:57:00,050","01:57:03,517",puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta...
1822,"01:57:04,358","01:57:05,580",black faces.
1823,"01:57:07,495","01:57:09,106","I spent my whole life here,"
1824,"01:57:09,606","01:57:10,562","right here,"
1825,"01:57:11,226","01:57:12,321","in Candyland,"
1826,"01:57:13,945","01:57:15,052","surrounded,"
1827,"01:57:15,826","01:57:17,505",by black faces.
1828,"01:57:19,786","01:57:22,574","Now, seeing them every day, day in, day out,"
1829,"01:57:23,424","01:57:25,129",I only had one question.
1830,"01:57:29,274","01:57:30,369",Why don't they kill us?
1831,"01:57:34,581","01:57:36,707","Now, right out there on that porch,"
1832,"01:57:37,343","01:57:39,491","three times a week for 50 years,"
1833,"01:57:39,999","01:57:41,182","Old Ben here,"
1834,"01:57:41,710","01:57:44,120",would shave my daddy with a straight razor.
1835,"01:57:45,260","01:57:45,930","Now,"
1836,"01:57:46,230","01:57:47,293","if I was Old Ben,"
1837,"01:57:47,625","01:57:50,216",I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat
1838,"01:57:50,439","01:57:53,590","and it would not have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither."
1839,"01:57:56,411","01:57:57,517",But he never did.
1840,"01:57:59,735","01:58:00,683",Why not?
1841,"01:58:02,201","01:58:03,041","You see,"
1842,"01:58:03,946","01:58:05,996",the science of phrenology
1843,"01:58:07,165","01:58:09,041",is crucial to understanding
1844,"01:58:09,634","01:58:12,253",the separation of our two species.
1845,"01:58:14,088","01:58:16,478","In the skull of the African here,"
1846,"01:58:18,092","01:58:20,496","the area associated with submissiveness,"
1847,"01:58:20,636","01:58:22,563",is larger than any human or
1848,"01:58:22,564","01:58:25,767",any other subhuman species on planet Earth.
1849,"01:58:41,769","01:58:43,054",If you examine...
1850,"01:58:44,619","01:58:46,788",this piece of skull here...
1851,"01:58:53,085","01:58:54,198","you will notice,"
1852,"01:58:54,566","01:58:57,039",three distinct dimples.
1853,"01:59:00,259","01:59:01,194","Here,"
1854,"01:59:01,934","01:59:02,641","here,"
1855,"01:59:03,078","01:59:03,858",and here.
1856,"01:59:04,305","01:59:05,007",Now...
1857,"01:59:05,653","01:59:07,588",if I was holding the skull of an
1858,"01:59:07,983","01:59:10,298","Isaac Newton or Galileo,"
1859,"01:59:10,880","01:59:14,796",these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull most associated with...
1860,"01:59:15,511","01:59:16,543",creativity.
1861,"01:59:17,549","01:59:18,940",But this is the skull of Old Ben.
1862,"01:59:20,126","01:59:21,676","And in the skull of Old Ben,"
1863,"01:59:22,156","01:59:24,035","unburdened by genius,"
1864,"01:59:24,617","01:59:28,650",these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with...
1865,"01:59:29,914","01:59:30,974",servility.
1866,"01:59:32,588","01:59:33,595","Now, Bright Boy."
1867,"01:59:34,919","01:59:36,845",I will admit you are pretty clever.
1868,"01:59:39,799","01:59:41,623",But if I took this hammer here...
1869,"01:59:44,018","01:59:45,955",and I bashed in your skull with it...
1870,"01:59:47,402","01:59:49,689","you would have the same three dimples,"
1871,"01:59:50,478","01:59:52,227","in the same place,"
1872,"01:59:53,688","01:59:54,921",as Old Ben.
1873,"01:59:56,416","01:59:57,611",Hey!
1874,"01:59:57,752","01:59:59,889",Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!
1875,"02:00:00,274","02:00:03,231","If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop,"
1876,"02:00:03,389","02:00:05,955",Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed-off.
1877,"02:00:07,878","02:00:10,951","There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight,"
1878,"02:00:11,097","02:00:12,624",but that you can believe!
1879,"02:00:13,826","02:00:14,595","Mr. Moguy,"
1880,"02:00:15,004","02:00:16,619",would you be so kind as to collect the pistol
1881,"02:00:16,621","02:00:18,119",hanging off these boys' hips here?
1882,"02:00:23,591","02:00:24,897",Thank you ever so much.
1883,"02:00:25,077","02:00:25,894",Doctor.
1884,"02:00:30,604","02:00:31,496",Where were we?
1885,"02:00:36,365","02:00:37,539",Jackass.
1886,"02:00:41,686","02:00:42,675",Ah yes.
1887,"02:00:43,556","02:00:44,592","I do believe,"
1888,"02:00:44,757","02:00:46,154","you were just getting ready to make me,"
1889,"02:00:46,173","02:00:48,104",a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
1890,"02:00:48,870","02:00:49,815",Am I right?
1891,"02:00:54,165","02:00:55,056",Right.
1892,"02:00:58,075","02:00:59,018",Bring out Hilda!
1893,"02:01:02,344","02:01:03,588",Get over there yonder.
1894,"02:01:05,176","02:01:07,428",Sit your ass in that goddamn...
1895,"02:01:07,595","02:01:08,995",Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.
1896,"02:01:09,013","02:01:10,390",Now shut your mouth!
1897,"02:01:14,852","02:01:15,870","Dr. Schultz,"
1898,"02:01:16,444","02:01:17,438","in Greenville,"
1899,"02:01:17,605","02:01:19,036","you yourself said,"
1900,"02:01:19,442","02:01:20,584","that for the right nigger,"
1901,"02:01:20,586","02:01:24,509",you'd be willing to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.
1902,"02:01:25,312","02:01:26,540","To which me myself said,"
1903,"02:01:26,845","02:01:28,578",What is your definition of ridiculous?
1904,"02:01:28,580","02:01:29,621","To which you said,"
1905,"02:01:30,261","02:01:32,203","$12,000."
1906,"02:01:33,210","02:01:34,334","Now considering,"
1907,"02:01:34,501","02:01:36,874","you all have ridden a whole lot of miles,"
1908,"02:01:37,204","02:01:38,618","went through a whole lot of trouble,"
1909,"02:01:39,090","02:01:41,380",and done spread a whole lot of bull
1910,"02:01:41,435","02:01:43,754","to purchase this lovely lady right here,"
1911,"02:01:43,756","02:01:45,769","it would appear that Broomhilda,"
1912,"02:01:45,871","02:01:46,931","is in fact,"
1913,"02:01:47,350","02:01:49,089",the right nigger.
1914,"02:01:50,279","02:01:52,826","And if you all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda,"
1915,"02:01:54,075","02:01:55,349",the price...
1916,"02:01:55,931","02:01:59,273","is $12,000."
1917,"02:01:59,801","02:02:03,602",And I take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiation?
1918,"02:02:05,653","02:02:06,927","Yes, I do doctor."
1919,"02:02:08,170","02:02:10,589","You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County,"
1920,"02:02:11,200","02:02:12,522","Broomhilda here,"
1921,"02:02:12,795","02:02:14,185",is my property.
1922,"02:02:14,912","02:02:16,866","And I can choose to do,"
1923,"02:02:16,999","02:02:18,233","with my property,"
1924,"02:02:18,348","02:02:19,982",whatever I so desire!
1925,"02:02:21,252","02:02:23,328",And if you all think my price...
1926,"02:02:24,388","02:02:25,958","for this nigger here,"
1927,"02:02:25,960","02:02:27,088",is too steep...
1928,"02:02:28,104","02:02:30,347",what I'm gonna desire to do is...
1929,"02:02:34,572","02:02:36,242","take this goddamn hammer here,"
1930,"02:02:36,243","02:02:37,789",and beat her ass to death with it!
1931,"02:02:37,791","02:02:40,242","Right in front of both you all! Easy, big fella."
1932,"02:02:40,244","02:02:42,448",Then we can examine the three dimples
1933,"02:02:42,661","02:02:44,442",inside Broomhilda's skull!
1934,"02:02:44,875","02:02:45,816","Now,"
1935,"02:02:46,273","02:02:47,716","what's it gonna be, doc?"
1936,"02:02:49,190","02:02:50,687",What's it gonna be?
1937,"02:02:50,689","02:02:54,064",May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold?
1938,"02:02:55,536","02:02:56,727","Yes, you may."
1939,"02:03:10,579","02:03:11,954",That 12.
1940,"02:03:15,624","02:03:17,051",Sold!
1941,"02:03:18,214","02:03:20,744",To the man with the exceptional beard
1942,"02:03:21,050","02:03:23,904",and his unexceptional nigger.
1943,"02:03:29,975","02:03:31,822","Mr. Moguy. Yes, Calvin?"
1944,"02:03:32,978","02:03:36,104","Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please?"
1945,"02:03:36,313","02:03:37,788","$12,000."
1946,"02:03:41,272","02:03:43,394",It was a pleasure doing business with you all.
1947,"02:03:44,043","02:03:45,156","Now gentlemen,"
1948,"02:03:47,004","02:03:48,881",if you care to join me in the parlor...
1949,"02:03:49,840","02:03:51,987",we will be serving white cake.
1950,"02:05:20,639","02:05:21,902","Well done, Calvin."
1951,"02:05:24,490","02:05:25,341",Excuse me.
1952,"02:05:26,169","02:05:27,357","Excuse me, ma'am?"
1953,"02:05:28,814","02:05:30,668",Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
1954,"02:05:31,254","02:05:32,912",Take your hands off the harp!
1955,"02:05:36,739","02:05:37,919",Doctor!
1956,"02:05:38,580","02:05:40,889","Doctor, you can't go in there! Stephen."
1957,"02:05:40,932","02:05:42,210",Stephen. He ain't got no business going in there.
1958,"02:05:42,226","02:05:43,054",Let it be.
1959,"02:05:43,788","02:05:45,539","He's just a little upset, that's all."
1960,"02:05:46,080","02:05:47,158",I'll handle this.
1961,"02:06:13,188","02:06:14,118",White cake?
1962,"02:06:15,356","02:06:17,387","I don't go in for sweets, thank you."
1963,"02:06:27,623","02:06:29,905",You brooding about me getting the best of you?
1964,"02:06:31,153","02:06:35,566","Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today."
1965,"02:06:35,994","02:06:37,111",D'Artagnan.
1966,"02:06:38,693","02:06:41,451",And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.
1967,"02:06:42,655","02:06:43,537",Come again?
1968,"02:06:47,297","02:06:48,706",Alexandre Dumas.
1969,"02:06:48,707","02:06:50,772",He wrote The Three Musketeers.
1970,"02:06:51,556","02:06:52,856","Yes, of course, doctor."
1971,"02:06:53,188","02:06:55,075",I figured you must be an admirer.
1972,"02:06:55,115","02:06:56,343","You named your slave,"
1973,"02:06:56,344","02:06:58,581",after his novel's lead character.
1974,"02:06:59,738","02:07:03,322","Now if, Alexandre Dumas had been there today,"
1975,"02:07:03,324","02:07:05,075",I wonder what he would have made of it.
1976,"02:07:07,563","02:07:08,950",You doubt he'd approve?
1977,"02:07:11,250","02:07:12,209",Yes.
1978,"02:07:12,210","02:07:16,144",His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.
1979,"02:07:18,903","02:07:20,291",Soft-hearted Frenchie.
1980,"02:07:22,581","02:07:24,364",Alexandre Dumas is black.
1981,"02:07:28,684","02:07:30,501",Are these Broomhilda's papers?
1982,"02:07:30,667","02:07:31,528","Yes, they are."
1983,"02:07:31,559","02:07:32,375",May I?
1984,"02:07:32,493","02:07:33,344",Of course.
1985,"02:07:33,472","02:07:34,237",Thank you.
1986,"02:07:37,096","02:07:40,104","That is her bill of sale, her ownership history,"
1987,"02:07:40,106","02:07:42,031","and of course, her freedom papers, doctor."
1988,"02:07:42,462","02:07:44,598",Would you have ink and pen for me?
1989,"02:07:45,869","02:07:48,230",Right over there on that little table. Thank you.
1990,"02:08:09,892","02:08:11,004",Thank you.
1991,"02:08:14,977","02:08:16,713",Broomhilda Von Shaft...
1992,"02:08:19,460","02:08:21,315",consider yourself a free woman.
1993,"02:08:33,766","02:08:35,336",Mr. Candie...
1994,"02:08:37,461","02:08:38,567","normally,"
1995,"02:08:39,387","02:08:41,118",I would say auf Wiedersehen.
1996,"02:08:41,699","02:08:45,886",But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is till I see you again
1997,"02:08:46,536","02:08:48,716","and since I never wish to see you again,"
1998,"02:08:48,717","02:08:49,795","to you sir,"
1999,"02:08:50,483","02:08:52,859","I say, goodbye."
2000,"02:08:57,106","02:08:58,019",Let's go.
2001,"02:08:59,412","02:09:00,501",Come on.
2002,"02:09:03,095","02:09:04,720","One more moment, doctor!"
2003,"02:09:06,870","02:09:07,716",What?
2004,"02:09:12,504","02:09:14,456","It's a custom here in the South,"
2005,"02:09:15,310","02:09:18,499","once a business deal is concluded that the two parties,"
2006,"02:09:19,124","02:09:20,118",shake hands.
2007,"02:09:21,482","02:09:22,884",It implies good faith.
2008,"02:09:23,644","02:09:25,873",I'm not from the South. But you are...
2009,"02:09:26,780","02:09:28,205","in my house, doctor."
2010,"02:09:29,928","02:09:31,491",So I'm afraid I must insist.
2011,"02:09:31,762","02:09:32,574",Insist?
2012,"02:09:33,027","02:09:33,806",On what?
2013,"02:09:34,278","02:09:35,234",That I shake your hand?
2014,"02:09:35,236","02:09:38,531","Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction."
2015,"02:09:39,134","02:09:40,582",You know what I think you are?
2016,"02:09:40,903","02:09:42,262",What you think I am?
2017,"02:09:42,264","02:09:43,588","No, I don't."
2018,"02:09:45,571","02:09:47,498",I think you are a bad loser.
2019,"02:09:48,049","02:09:50,784",And I think you're an abysmal winner.
2020,"02:09:51,240","02:09:52,453","Nevertheless,"
2021,"02:09:53,117","02:09:55,914","here in Chickasaw County a deal, ain't done..."
2022,"02:09:56,510","02:09:58,784",until the two parties have shook hands.
2023,"02:09:59,593","02:10:02,429","Even after all that paper signing, don't mean shit..."
2024,"02:10:03,496","02:10:04,465",you...
2025,"02:10:05,008","02:10:06,498",don't shake my hand.
2026,"02:10:07,936","02:10:10,794","If I don't shake your hand,"
2027,"02:10:11,266","02:10:13,328","you're gonna throw away $12,000?"
2028,"02:10:13,932","02:10:15,195",I don't think so.
2029,"02:10:16,926","02:10:17,904",Mr. Pooch?
2030,"02:10:19,837","02:10:23,637","If she tries to leave here before this nigger-loving German shakes my hand,"
2031,"02:10:24,615","02:10:25,843",you cut her ass down.
2032,"02:10:48,403","02:10:51,181",You really want me to shake your hand?
2033,"02:10:53,251","02:10:54,567",I insist.
2034,"02:10:56,133","02:10:57,911",If you insist.
2035,"02:11:15,336","02:11:18,038",No! Calvin!
2036,"02:11:19,122","02:11:21,166",Calvin!
2037,"02:11:27,047","02:11:27,972",I'm sorry.
2038,"02:11:28,355","02:11:29,604",I couldn't resist.
2039,"02:11:41,812","02:11:43,824",Nigger's gone crazy! Help!
2040,"02:11:44,147","02:11:45,980","Help, he's killing everyone!"
2041,"02:12:03,093","02:12:03,975",Holy!

2048,"02:12:22,613","02:12:25,082",What the fuck is going on?
2049,"02:12:26,037","02:12:27,333",You shot me!
2050,"02:12:27,437","02:12:30,184","You stupid son of a bitch! Sorry, Jessie!"
2051,"02:12:30,764","02:12:34,656",Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun?
2052,"02:13:04,858","02:13:05,595",Aim low!
2053,"02:13:08,479","02:13:09,983",Nigger! Gonna kill!

2067,"02:15:09,305","02:15:11,390",he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
2068,"02:15:12,063","02:15:13,779","And that ain't no threat, horse boy."
2069,"02:15:14,736","02:15:15,937",That there is a promise.
2070,"02:15:17,652","02:15:18,527",Or...
2071,"02:15:19,231","02:15:20,305","you can give up,"

2099,"02:18:25,548","02:18:28,047",I knew there was something fishy about you all.

2103,"02:18:38,416","02:18:40,929",I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.
2104,"02:18:41,655","02:18:44,699",Black boy paid to kill white men? How'd you like that line of work?
2105,"02:18:45,782","02:18:47,963",Probably pretty good while it lasted?
2106,"02:18:58,191","02:18:59,975","Time to say good night to them nuts, blackie."
2107,"02:19:00,554","02:19:01,437",On three.

2114,"02:19:14,736","02:19:17,501",Something to do with the Old Man's funeral.
2115,"02:19:18,747","02:19:22,057","Oh, and she changed her mind about snipping Django."
2116,"02:19:23,334","02:19:25,930",She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people.
2117,"02:19:27,917","02:19:29,922","Well, she didn't waste a minute telling me."
2118,"02:19:37,123","02:19:38,594",How disappointing.

2124,"02:20:18,676","02:20:22,498",Seem like white folk ain't never had a bright idea in they life
2125,"02:20:22,522","02:20:25,001",was coming up with all kinds of ways to kill your ass.
2126,"02:20:25,290","02:20:30,070","Now mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fucking with your fun parts."
2127,"02:20:30,888","02:20:31,597","Now,"
2128,"02:20:31,661","02:20:32,923","that may seem,"
2129,"02:20:33,119","02:20:34,527","like a good idea,"
2130,"02:20:34,785","02:20:36,004","but truth is,"
2131,"02:20:37,876","02:20:40,403","when you snip a nigger's nuts,"
2132,"02:20:40,427","02:20:42,484","most of them bleed out in, oh, about..."
2133,"02:20:43,696","02:20:44,560",seven minutes.
2134,"02:20:44,562","02:20:45,518",Most of them.
2135,"02:20:46,356","02:20:47,070","Well,"
2136,"02:20:48,331","02:20:49,526",more than most.
2137,"02:20:50,400","02:20:51,652",Then I says.
2138,"02:20:53,444","02:20:55,052",Shitfire.
2139,"02:20:56,421","02:20:58,720",The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
2140,"02:20:58,721","02:21:00,286",got it worse than that.
2141,"02:21:01,463","02:21:02,822",And they still saying.
2142,"02:21:02,823","02:21:04,263",Let's whip him to death.
2143,"02:21:04,482","02:21:07,502",Or Throw him to the Mandingos. Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.
2144,"02:21:07,827","02:21:08,782",And I said.
2145,"02:21:09,001","02:21:10,880",What's so special about that?
2146,"02:21:11,306","02:21:13,174",We do that shit all the time.
2147,"02:21:13,404","02:21:14,535",Hell's bells.

2150,"02:21:20,604","02:21:22,848","Lo and behold,"
2151,"02:21:23,389","02:21:24,716","out of nowhere,"
2152,"02:21:24,717","02:21:27,369","Miss Lara come up with the bright idea,"
2153,"02:21:28,387","02:21:31,531",of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
2154,"02:21:34,419","02:21:35,628","And as a slave,"
2155,"02:21:36,418","02:21:38,495","of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,"

2238,"02:25:29,223","02:25:31,974",We finally found their ass laying low in Candyland.
2239,"02:25:32,141","02:25:33,547","We went in there to get them,"
2240,"02:25:34,043","02:25:35,243","things went sour,"

2243,"02:25:39,393","02:25:41,521","then everybody there decided to blame me,"
2244,"02:25:42,045","02:25:43,105",so here I am.
2245,"02:25:45,644","02:25:47,362",But you all know I ain't on that manifest.
2246,"02:25:47,772","02:25:50,099",And all you all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

2249,"02:25:54,038","02:25:57,399","and that 11,500 is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect"
2250,"02:25:57,538","02:25:59,470",is you all riding back in there and getting it.
2251,"02:25:59,919","02:26:01,195",What's the deal?
2252,"02:26:02,007","02:26:04,158",You tell us who they are and we...

2259,"02:26:17,024","02:26:18,509",This is a real handbill.
2260,"02:26:18,740","02:26:20,182",Now just because it's a real handbill
2261,"02:26:20,184","02:26:22,191",doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is.
2262,"02:26:22,482","02:26:23,684","Now why,"
2263,"02:26:23,685","02:26:27,019",would a slave have a Wanted Dead or Alive handbill
2264,"02:26:27,266","02:26:28,545",in his pocket?
2265,"02:26:33,107","02:26:35,901",Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday?
2266,"02:26:42,248","02:26:43,324","Alright,"

2270,"02:26:52,597","02:26:56,094",or did he ride in with a white man on a horse yesterday?
2271,"02:26:56,640","02:26:57,333",Yeah.
2272,"02:26:58,676","02:27:00,833","They walked us from the Greenville auction,"
2273,"02:27:00,888","02:27:02,754",and he rode in on a horse with a white man.
2274,"02:27:03,608","02:27:05,255","Now this white man,"
2275,"02:27:06,109","02:27:07,715",was the black his slave?
2276,"02:27:08,173","02:27:09,447",He weren't no slave.
2277,"02:27:10,064","02:27:11,912",You fucking sure about that?

2283,"02:27:24,160","02:27:25,058",The German.
2284,"02:27:25,410","02:27:26,453",Why'd he do that?
2285,"02:27:27,211","02:27:29,859",Nigger and the German was acting like they were slavers but they wasn't.
2286,"02:27:30,920","02:27:32,139","Well, what were they?"
2287,"02:27:32,746","02:27:34,006",Bounty hunters.
2288,"02:27:35,177","02:27:37,871","Fuck me, Roy. I mean, this could be big, mate."
